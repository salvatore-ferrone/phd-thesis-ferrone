# Streaming Galactic Globular Clusters

## Foreward
This is the barebones of my senior thesis. I uploaded my mid-thesis report to this GitHub Pages site on December 9, 2024. I will continue to work on this in the coming months and submit it in July. I hope this thesis is coherent enough that anyone with a bachelor's degree in physics can understand the majority of the work, as well as thorough and relevant enough to be a valid contribution to the scientific body of astronomy.


As part of making this thesis available and online before submission, please send me comments or questions or things that would be cool to see before I submit! salvatore.ferrone@uniroma1.it
