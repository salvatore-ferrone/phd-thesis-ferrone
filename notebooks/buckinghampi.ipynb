    "The power of dimensional analysis of the equations of motion is typically reserved for fluid mechanics courses, however, in dynamics, we can learn a lot from a great dimensional analysis. Moreover, it provides the best units for numerical intergration which can avoid rounding error from using combinations of numbers with large orders of magnitude far from unity. Also, units in galactic dynamics can be quite unintuitive at first glance and differ from SI units. I have revisted this theme multiple times, and I can say that my understand has not grown to a maximum until I learned about the Buckingham $\\Pi$ theorem."
