<h1 class="title">Theory</h1>
</header>
<p>In this chapter, I present the theoretical background necessary to
understand the modeling of globular clusters and stellar streams
performed in this thesis. Much of the content draws from two
comprehensive introductions to galactic dynamics: Galactic Dynamics by
Binney and Tremaine, and Galaxiesbook.org by Bovy. These references
provide a solid foundation for the physics and mathematical tools used
throughout this work.</p>
<p>A common assumption in galactic dynamics is the so-called fluid
limit, in which the orbit of a star is determined by the smooth
gravitational potential generated by the galaxy as a whole. In this
approximation, interactions between individual stars are negligible.
This assumption holds well in many contexts—but not in all.</p>
<p>Globular clusters are a notable exception. Their relatively small
number of stars makes them too “grainy” for the fluid approximation to
hold, yet they contain far too many stars to be treated as simple
few-body systems. This intermediate regime is the subject of the aptly
named Million Body Problem, explored in detail by Heggie and Hut. Their
textbook provides a thorough survey of methods to address this
challenge, and their preface offers an insightful summary of the central
difficulty: globular clusters inhabit an awkward middle ground where
neither the fluid limit nor simplified few-body interactions apply
cleanly. As a result, no analytical theory fully captures their
dynamics.</p>
<p>While this thesis focuses primarily on stellar streams—specifically,
how stars escape from globular clusters and evolve under the influence
of the galactic potential—it is important to acknowledge that the
internal evolution of the progenitor clusters still affects the
properties of the streams. Although the internal cluster dynamics lie
outside the scope of this work, they place important constraints on the
interpretation of our results.</p>
<p>The remainder of this chapter is structured to clarify the
theoretical framework supporting this thesis. I divide the discussion
into three main parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Explicit physics</strong> - the physical laws and initial
conditions implemented in the simulations;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implicit physics</strong> - the emergent behavior of
these systems, the assumptions involved, and the mathematical tools used
to interpret the results;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ignored physics</strong> - relevant aspects of the
problem that are beyond the scope of this thesis, but which impact the
interpretation of our results. Where appropriate, I cite works that
pursue these directions and discuss how future work could incorporate
them to improve upon the current modeling.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-explicit-physics">The Explicit Physics</h1>
<p>My simulations solve the <em>restricted three body problem</em>. In
essence</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/restricted_three_body_set_up.png" />
<figcaption>Little sketch of my equations of motion. </figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="subsec:myEquationsOfMotion">Equations of Motion</h2>
<p>I like to start with the <em>Lagrangian</em>, which comes from the
variational principle which states that particles with move along
trajectories that minimize the difference, <span class="math inline">\(L
= T-U\)</span>, which <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is the
Lagrangian, <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is the kinetic energy
and <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is the potential energy.
Also, as is almost always the case in gravitational dynamics, we
normalize by the mass and use <em>specific</em> energy: <span
class="math display">\[\mathcal{L} = \frac{L}{m} =
\frac{1}{2}\left(\dot{x}^2+\dot{y}^2+\dot{z}^2\right) -
\Phi(x,y,z).\]</span> However, Lagrange’s equations give a system of
three second order coupled ordinary differential equations. If we switch
to Hamiltonain dynamics, we can object a set of six <em>first</em> order
ordinary differential equations, which is easier to implement
computationally. Also, since we are using the specific energy, the
momentum coordinates for Hamilton’s equations are the same as the
velocities from the Lagrangian: <span class="math inline">\(p_i =
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{q}_i}\)</span>. Therefore,
<span class="math inline">\(p_i = \dot{q}_i\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(i \in \left(x,y,z\right)\)</span>. The Hamilton is
derived through the Legendre transform: <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}=\sum_i p_i\dot{q}_i -
\mathcal{L}\)</span>. Then, we can apply Hamilton’s equations to obtain
the set of equations: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
            \dot{p}_i &amp;= -\frac{\partial \mathcal{H}}{\partial q_i}
\\
            \dot{q}_i &amp;= \frac{\partial \mathcal{H}}{\partial p_i}
        
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>And when written explicity become: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
            \dot{p}_x &amp;= -\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial x} \\
            \dot{p}_y &amp;= -\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial y} \\
            \dot{p}_z &amp;= -\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial z} \\
            \dot{x} &amp;= p_x \\
            \dot{y} &amp;= p_y \\
            \dot{z} &amp;= p_z \\

<h2 id="the-tidal-tensor">The tidal tensor</h2>
<p>Tidal forces arise due to spatial variations in the gravitational
field and are especially apparent when comparing the accelerations
experienced by nearby particles. To explore this, consider a Taylor
expansion of the gravitational potential of the primary, <span
class="math inline">\(\Phi_g\)</span>, evaluated at the star’s position
<span class="math inline">\(\vec{x}_s\)</span>, relative to the
secondary’s position <span class="math inline">\(\vec{x}_c\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[\Phi_g\left(\vec{x}_s\right) \approx
\Phi_g\left(\vec{x}_c\right) + \left[\nabla \Phi_g (\vec{x}_c)\cdot
\Delta \vec{x}\right] + \left[\Delta \vec{x} \cdot
\mathcal{D}^2\left(\Phi_g\right) \cdot \Delta\vec{x}\right],\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \vec{x} = \vec{x}_s -
\vec{x}_c\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{D}^2
\Phi_g\)</span> is the Hessian matrix of second derivatives of the
potential: <span class="math inline">\(\partial^2 \Phi/\partial x_i
\partial x_j\)</span>.</p>
<p>An equivalent expression can be derived by linearizing the
gravitational force in a non-inertial frame co-moving with the
secondary. Let us write Newton’s second law for the star-particle and
the secondary in an inertial frame: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
            \vec{F}_s &amp;= \nabla \Phi_c\left(\Delta \vec{x}\right) +
\nabla \Phi_g\left(\vec{x}_s\right),\\
            \vec{F}_c &amp;= \nabla \Phi_g\left(\vec{x}_c\right).
        
\end{aligned}\]</span> Then the relative acceleration of the star in the
non-inertial frame is: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
            \vec{f}_s &amp;= \vec{F}_s - \vec{F}_c +
\vec{F}_\mathrm{fictitious} \\
                    &amp;= \nabla \Phi_c\left(\Delta \vec{x}\right) +
\nabla \Phi_g\left(\vec{x}_s\right) - \nabla
\Phi_g\left(\vec{x}_c\right) + \vec{F}_\mathrm{fictitious} \\
                    &amp;\approx \nabla \Phi_c\left(\Delta
\vec{x}\right) + \mathrm{Jac}\left(\nabla \Phi_g(\vec{x}_c)\right) \cdot
\Delta \vec{x} + \vec{F}_\mathrm{fictitious},
        
\end{aligned}\]</span> where the last line uses a first-order Taylor
expansion of the gravitational force field, valid under the assumption
that <span class="math inline">\(|\Delta \vec{x}| \ll
|\vec{x}_c|\)</span>.</p>
<p>The Jacobian of the gravitational field is equal to the Hessian of
the potential, owing to the symmetry of second derivatives and the fact
that <span class="math inline">\(\vec{g} = -\nabla \Phi_g\)</span>. This
matrix, known as the <em>tidal tensor</em> <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{T}\)</span>, describes the linearized
spatial variation of the gravitational field: <span
class="math display">\[\mathcal{T} = -\mathcal{D}^2\Phi_g =
\mathrm{Jac}(\nabla \Phi_g) = \left(\begin{matrix}
                \partial_x g_x &amp; \partial_y g_x &amp; \partial_z g_x
\\
                \partial_x g_y &amp; \partial_y g_y &amp; \partial_z g_y
\\
                \partial_x g_z &amp; \partial_y g_z &amp; \partial_z g_z
            \end{matrix}\right).\]</span></p>
<p>While the Hessian and Jacobian are formally equivalent, the Jacobian
viewpoint offers a more geometric interpretation: it acts as a linear
transformation on nearby displacements, mapping them to differences in
acceleration. Diagonalizing the tidal tensor reveals the principal axes
of tidal deformation. A positive eigenvalue corresponds to stretching
along the associated eigenvector; a negative eigenvalue indicates
compression. The magnitude gives the rate of stretching or
compression.</p>
<p>Finally, we note that although many relevant potentials exhibit
spherical or cylindrical symmetry, Cartesian coordinates are preferred
here. In curvilinear systems, computing the Jacobian or Hessian requires
accounting for Christoffel symbols, which complicates the interpretation
and computation.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="the-moon">The Moon</h3>
<p>Nothing clarifies the concept of tides like the most familiar
example: the Moon. Tidal forces are invoked to explain a wide range of
phenomena in the Earth-Moon system. The most relatable effect is, of
course, the periodic variation in sea level on Earth. While accurately
modeling these changes requires fluid dynamics—beyond the scope of this
thesis—NASA provides several accessible explanations and visualizations
at <a
href="https://science.nasa.gov/moon/tides/">https://science.nasa.gov/moon/tides/</a>,
including daily high and low tides, as well as spring and neap
tides.</p>
<p>Another key example is the tidal deformation of the Moon, which
ultimately led to its tidal locking—explaining why we always see the
same side of the Moon from Earth.</p>
<p>A particularly insightful illustration is the angular offset between
the Earth’s tidal bulge and the Moon’s position, caused by the Earth’s
rotation. This offset results in a torque that transfers angular
momentum from the Earth’s rotation to the Moon’s orbit. As a
consequence, Earth’s rotation gradually slows while the Moon slowly
recedes from Earth. Much of this behavior can be understood
qualitatively using the tidal tensor for a Keplerian potential: <span
class="math display">\[\mathcal{T}= -\frac{GM}{r^3}\left(\begin{matrix}
                    1-\frac{3x^2}{r^2} &amp; -\frac{3xy}{r^2} &amp;
-\frac{3xz}{r^2} \\
                    -\frac{3yx}{r^2} &amp; 1-\frac{3y^2}{r^2} &amp;
-\frac{3yz}{r^2} \\
                    -\frac{3zx}{r^2} &amp; -\frac{3zy}{r^2} &amp;
1-\frac{3z^2}{r^2}
                \end{matrix}\right),\]</span> which has eigenvalues
<span class="math inline">\(2\frac{GM}{r^3}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(-\frac{GM}{r^3}\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(-\frac{GM}{r^3}\)</span>, with corresponding
eigenvectors: <span class="math display">\[\vec{v}_1,\vec{v}_2,\vec{v}_3
= \dfrac{1}{r}\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix},
\dfrac{1}{r}\begin{bmatrix} -x \\ y \\ 0 \end{bmatrix},
\dfrac{1}{r}\begin{bmatrix} -x \\ 0 \\ z \end{bmatrix}.\]</span></p>
<p>Notably, the first eigenvalue is positive and corresponds to a
stretching deformation along the position vector. The other two are
negative, representing compression in directions perpendicular to the
stretching axis. These directions define a plane orthogonal to the
Earth-Moon line. From this, several tidal effects become evident. For
instance, the Earth’s oceans stretch along the Earth-Moon axis due to
the Moon’s tidal forces. While the Sun also exerts tidal forces on
Earth, their magnitude is weaker due to the <span
class="math inline">\(r^{-3}\)</span> scaling with distance.</p>
<p>When the Moon is either full or new, the Sun and Moon’s tidal forces
act constructively, leading to spring tides. At first and third
quarters, they interfere destructively, causing neap tides.
Additionally, Earth’s tidal influence distorts the Moon from spherical
symmetry into an ellipsoid. The Moon’s most stable orientation is one
where its longest axis aligns with the Earth-Moon line—resulting in
tidal locking.</p>
<p>A more quantitative treatment of these phenomena would require
modeling the Moon’s internal structure and Earth’s ocean dynamics—well
beyond the gravity-only scope of this thesis. However, we can still
explore one instructive effect: how solar tidal forces <em>perturb</em>
the Moon’s orbit away from the idealized two-body Earth-Moon
configuration. Figure <a href="#fig:moon_tidal_simulation"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:moon_tidal_simulation">1</a> shows a toy model
comparing two scenarios. In both, I used initial conditions based on JPL
NASA ephemerides (citation needed) and integrated two sets of equations
of motion.</p>
<p>In the first scenario, the Moon’s motion is governed by the two-body
Earth-Moon problem with a rotating reference frame correction: <span
class="math display">\[\ddot{\vec{r}} = -\frac{GM_\oplus}{r^3}\vec{r} -
\omega_\oplus \times \left(\omega_\oplus \times
\vec{r}_\oplus\right),\]</span> while in the second, we include the
effect of solar tidal forces: <span
class="math display">\[\ddot{\vec{r}} = -\frac{GM_\oplus}{r^3}\vec{r} -
\omega_\oplus \times \left(\omega_\oplus \times \vec{r}_\oplus\right)
-\frac{GM_\odot}{r_\oplus^3}
                \left(\begin{matrix}
                    1-\frac{3x^2}{r_\oplus^2} &amp;
-\frac{3xy}{r_\oplus^2} &amp; -\frac{3xz}{r_\oplus^2} \\
                    -\frac{3yx}{r_\oplus^2} &amp;
1-\frac{3y^2}{r_\oplus^2} &amp; -\frac{3yz}{r_\oplus^2} \\
                    -\frac{3zx}{r_\oplus^2} &amp;
-\frac{3zy}{r_\oplus^2} &amp; 1-\frac{3z^2}{r_\oplus^2}
                \end{matrix}  \right) \cdot \vec{r},\]</span> where
<span class="math inline">\(r_\oplus\)</span> is the Earth’s position
relative to the Sun, <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}\)</span> is the
Moon’s position relative to Earth, <span

the simpler two-body problem that neglects them. The black ellipse
represents the tidal ellipsoid, whose major axis remains aligned with
the Sun’s position vector relative to the Earth. The bottom panel shows
the accumulated phase difference between the two solutions. Neglecting
solar tides causes the predicted Moon orbit to drift ahead of the more
accurate trajectory. With about three to four years, the two body
predicted solution would off by half a moon phase. </figcaption>

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="interesting-case">Interesting case</h3>
<p>There is an interesting area in the parameter space where the tidal
forces would impede creating stellar streams instead of making them, as
shown in Fig. <a href="#fig:martos_tidal_field_small_r"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:martos_tidal_field_small_r">7</a>.</p>
<p>Taking the Martos tidal tensor in Eq. <a href="#eq:martos_f_s"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="eq:martos_f_s">[eq:martos_f_s]</a>, we can see that for
<span class="math inline">\(\gamma &gt; 3\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(s \ll  1\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(f(s)&lt; 0\)</span>. Physically, this would be a
sphere whose density increases with distance. This is not natural, as,
in general, gravity sends the more massive objects towards the center.
However, it’s fun to indulge in this situation to learn some insight
about the flexibility of tidal fields. The consequence of <span
class="math inline">\(f(s)&lt; 0\)</span> is that all terms in the tidal
tensor are negative, which means that the force is compressive
everywhere. Consequently, no stars escape from the cluster.</p>
<p>In Fig. <a href="#fig:martos_tidal_field_small_r"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:martos_tidal_field_small_r">7</a>, I present a small
experiment demonstrating the consequence of such a tidal force on a
globular cluster, which is that no tidal stream forms. Briefly, I
created a plummer sphere of <span
class="math inline">\(10^6\)</span> M<span
class="math inline">\(_\odot\)</span> and half mass radius 20 pc and
evolved it in a Martos halo potential of mass parameter <span
class="math inline">\(10^{12}\)</span> M<span
class="math inline">\(_\odot\)</span> a characteristic radius of <span
class="math inline">\(30\)</span> kpc. Each cluster was placed at the
same initial conditions, a distance of 1/4 the scale radius from the
center of the potential. The initial velocity was made perpendicular to
the position vector with a speed of <span
class="math inline">\((1-e)v_\textrm{c}\)</span>. This is a
pseudo-eccentricity, which was added to have a non-circular orbit to
demonstrate how the trajectories change in the two cases. The top panel
uses a <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> of 2.02, which is the
same value in the model where the halo was originally presented, and the
value I employ in this thesis. Next, the bottom panel uses <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> of 4.5, which corresponds to a
density profile where <span class="math inline">\(\rho(r) \propto
r^{1.5}\)</span>.</p>
<p>To get a feel for the strength of the tidal stretching and
compression, I show a circle and the resulting ellipse after applying
the tidal deformation. I computed the coordinates of the ellipse by
adding <span class="math inline">\(\vec{Ell} = \vec{C} + \frac{1}{2}
t_\textrm{char}^2 \mathcal{T}\cdot \left(\vec{C} -
\vec{r_o}\right)\)</span>. This way, force can be mapped to position
space, and the strengths of the tidal forces can be seen visually. The
characteristic time, <span
class="math inline">\(t_\textrm{char}\)</span>, was set to <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{10} 2\pi r_\textrm{halo} /
v_\textrm{c}\)</span>.</p>

<figcaption>The plots show two low-resolution streams (N = 1000) created
by dissolving a Plummer sphere in the Martos halo potential. The units
are scaled to the halo’s characteristic radius. Gamma is the mass
exponent and is the sole variable between the two simulations. The
panels on the left show the orbit in gray and the stars in black. The
black arrow points towards the center of the potential. The panels on
the right show the tidal field, which is the tidal tensor evaluated at
each position in space. The gray dotted circle is plotted with an
arbitrary radius and is deformed by the tidal field into a black
ellipse.</figcaption>

<figcaption>The same experiment as Fig. <a

data-reference="fig:martos_tidal_field_small_r">7</a>, but the cluster
was placed at a larger distance of 4 <span
class="math inline">\(r_\textrm{halo}\)</span>, since we are beyond the
characteristic radius, the tidal fields are the same, despite the
different exponents <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>.</figcaption>

<p>In the case of Fig. <a href="#fig:martos_tidal_field_big_r"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:martos_tidal_field_big_r">8</a>, the tidal field
returns to the typical situation where one axis is compressive and the
other stretches. Notice how the deformations are similar in magnitude,
while in the case of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma=2.02\)</span>
for the top panel of Fig. <a href="#fig:martos_tidal_field_small_r"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:martos_tidal_field_small_r">7</a>, the compression
is stronger than the expansion. Both of these are different than the
keplerian tidal deformation where the stronger deformation is stretching
and whose axis is parallel to the position vector.</p>

<h2 id="shocks">Shocks</h2>
<p>I started this section with the circular and planar restricted three
body problem. It really simplifies the problem instead of looking for a
general solution. All three bodies are point masses, in fact the
tertiary body has no mass. The secondary is on a circular orbit about
the primary, and the tertiary is in the same orbital plane as the
secondary. This simplified problem is already quite complex but solvable
and rich with physics. However, by restricting the orbits of the
tertiary and secondary, we lose a lot of physics that affects our
system. Additionally, for the globular clustres, most of them are not on
circular orbits. Additionally, the galaxy is not a point mass, but
rather a mass distribution with cylindrical symmetry.</p>

<p>In someways, we take time evolution into account, and in someways, we
ignore and this has already been covered in the previous sections. i.e.,
the orbit of the star-particles depend on the position of the host
globular cluster, which I do not solve for simoltaneously but instead
opt to load it into the computation, as shown in Section <a
href="#subsec:myEquationsOfMotion" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="subsec:myEquationsOfMotion">1.1</a>. Also, things like
mass segregation and stellar evolution are time-dependent which is
completely ignored in my simulations.</p>
