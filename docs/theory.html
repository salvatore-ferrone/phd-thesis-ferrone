<p>In this chapter, I summarize the theoretical background necessary to
understand how we model the disruption of globular clusters to form
stellar streams. My goals are threefold:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>To describe the modeling process in detail;</p></li>
<li><p>To describe the physical mechanisms that govern this
process;</p></li>
<li><p>To acknowledge other physical ingredients that are relevant to
globular cluster evolution but were deliberately omitted in our
modeling, and to discuss the consequences of these omissions.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This chapter serves multiple roles: half learning resource for a
Master’s-level student interested in modeling stellar streams; half
documentation and reflection for myself, consolidating what I’ve
learned; half annotated bibliography pointing to more complete
references; and half justification for the methodological choices made
in this project. That’s four halves—because none of them is fully
complete on its own. Still, together they form something useful. I tried
to write the chapter I wish I could hand to myself in 2022 to jump-start
this research.</p>
<p>Conceptually, the chapter is divided into three sections that mirror
these motivations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Explicit physics</strong>: These are the fundamental
equations that underpin our models;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implicit physics</strong>: Often, while the governing
equations can be written exactly, they are too terse to provide
intuition. This section interprets simplified versions of the equations
to explain qualitatively what’s happening in the simulations;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ignored physics</strong>: Here I highlight physical
effects excluded from our models, many of which appear in the broader
literature. I discuss why we excluded them and how that limits our
results.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-explicit-physics">The Explicit Physics</h1>
<p>Globular clusters are dense stellar systems containing hundreds of
thousands to millions of stars. Each star orbits within the
gravitational potential of the cluster, while the cluster itself orbits
the center of mass of the host galaxy. The galaxy, in turn, is composed
of billions of stars, along with gas and dark matter, all contributing
to its gravitational potential. A natural modeling approach is to treat
the stars as point masses and to represent the gas and dark matter as
continuous density distributions. This strategy would allow the
construction of the Galactic gravitational field, potentially through a
combination of hydrodynamical simulations for the gas and <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span>-body simulations for the stars and dark
matter. However, the feasibility of such an approach must be carefully
considered.</p>
<p>The scaling of computation time is often analyzed using Big-O
notation. For direct <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>-body
simulations, the computational cost scales as <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}(N^2)\)</span>, since the gravitational
force on each particle must be computed from every other particle. For
the Milky Way, with approximately <span
class="math inline">\(10^{11}\)</span> stars, we need to compute <span
class="math inline">\(5 \times 10^{21}\)</span> pairwise distances per
time step.</p>
<p>Let us consider the practicality of performing such a computation.
<em>Frontier</em> is one of the most powerful modern supercomputers and
operates at approximately one exaflop, or <span
class="math inline">\(10^{18}\)</span> FLOPS (Floating Point Operations
Per Second) <span class="citation"
data-cites="atchley2023frontier">(<strong>atchley2023frontier?</strong>)</span>.
Assuming—conservatively—that each pairwise computation requires a single
FLOP, a full <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>-body computation of
the Galaxy at one time step would still require several hours. While
this may seem manageable, a single time step is insufficient for
modeling the long-term evolution of the system, which could require
millions of steps or more. Dedicating an entire exascale machine to such
a task is therefore a considerable demand.</p>
<p>Moreover, the cost of power is non-negligible. At an estimated rate
of <span class="math inline">\(\sim
0.10~\mathrm{USD}/\mathrm{kWh}\)</span> <span class="citation"
data-cites="table20245">(<strong>table20245?</strong>)</span>, and with
Frontier consuming roughly 21 MW, a single 6-hour computation would cost
approximately 12,600 USD. Running the system for a full day would amount
to about 50,000 USD, or  42,000 EUR <span class="citation"
data-cites="ECB_USD_EUR_2025">(<strong>ECB_USD_EUR_2025?</strong>)</span>.
This is nearly twice the annual salary of a PhD student in France <span
class="citation"
data-cites="MESR_financement_doctoral">(<strong>MESR_financement_doctoral?</strong>)</span>.</p>
<p>Throughout this thesis, I have access to the Pairs observatoy’s super
computer <span class="citation"
data-cites="DIO_OBSPM">(<strong>DIO_OBSPM?</strong>)</span>, which
currently has about 85 nodes. However, as a humorous aside, consider
attempting this computation on a personal research laptop, such as a
MacBook Air with an M2 processor. Its estimated speed of <span
class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span>0.1 TFLOPS (i.e., <span
class="math inline">\(10^{11}\)</span> FLOPS) <span class="citation"
data-cites="hubner2025apple">(<strong>hubner2025apple?</strong>)</span>
is approximately 10 million times slower than Frontier. A single time
step would thus take over 1,500 years.</p>
<p>Clearly, we require a more tractable modeling approach for studying
the evolution of globular clusters and the formation of stellar streams.
Fortunately, it is well justified to approximate all the stars in the
galaxy as a smooth background density field rather than as a collection
of point masses. This argument, presented in Section 1.2 of <span
class="citation" data-cites="2008gady.book.....B">Binney and Tremaine
(2008)</span>, shows that the inaccuracy of such a model becomes
significant only on timescales far exceeding the age of the Universe.
This is known as two-body relaxation. This process compares two
hypothetical orbits for the same star. One within a smooth medium, and a
second within a medium composed of point masses. The two-body relaxation
time is how long it takes for these two trajectories to deviate
significantly. We revist this in Section XXX.</p>
<p>In globular clusters, where stars are densely packed into a
relatively small volume, stellar encounters become significant over the
system’s lifetime. According to Chapter 5.1 of <span class="citation"
data-cites="bovy_inprep">(<strong>bovy_inprep?</strong>)</span>, the
relaxation timescale within globular clusters is typically <span
class="math inline">\(\sim1\)</span> Gyr. To contextualize this, we must
consider the orbital period of a typical star within a cluster, and the
age of a cluster. First, the characteristic time for a star to traverse
the system—is roughly 1 Myr <span class="citation"
data-cites="2018MNRAS.478.1520B">(which can be estimated as the size of
a system divided by its internal velocity dispersion Baumgardt and
Hilker 2018)</span>. Secondly, globular clusters are old systems, with
ages ranging from several billion to over ten billion years <span
class="citation" data-cites="2013ApJ...775..134V">(VandenBerg et al.
2013)</span>. These timescales establish the following hierarchy for
globular clusters: <span class="math display">\[t_\mathrm{cross}
&lt;&lt; t_\mathrm{relax} &lt; t_\mathrm{age}\]</span></p>
<p>This has two major consequences. First, because the crossing time is
much shorter than the relaxation time, the cluster can be considered in
dynamical equilibrium at any given moment. The stars thus follow orbits
determined by a smooth potential. Second, since the age of the cluster
exceeds the relaxation time, cumulative stellar encounters (i.e.,
“collisions”) significantly influence the system’s long-term
evolution.</p>
<p>Despite the importance of collisional effects for the long-term
evolution of globular clusters, explicitly modeling them via direct
<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>-body simulations remains
prohibitively expensive for our purposes. We return to this point in
more detail in Section <a href="#sec:ignoredphysics"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:ignoredphysics">3</a>. In
this thesis, we therefore adopt the collisionless approximation for both
the Galactic background and the globular cluster. While this is
well-justified for the Galaxy, treating the cluster as collisionless is
a simplification that limits the generality of our results. Nonetheless,
our goal is to accurately model the stellar streams, and the internal
dynamics of the globular clusters are beyond the scope of this work.</p>
<p>To make the problem computationally tractable, we model the stars as
test particles—massless bodies that feel the gravitational potential but
do not contribute to it. The Galaxy and the globular cluster are each
represented as smooth, time-independent density distributions. In this
approximation, the stars do not interact with one another or with the
cluster, and their trajectories are determined solely by the external
potentials. This setup is a version of the <em>restricted three-body
problem</em>, in which the Galaxy acts as the primary body (fixed at the
origin), the globular cluster as the secondary (modeled by its center of
mass), and the star as the tertiary object. This is shown in Fig. <a
href="#fig:restricted_three_body_set_up" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:restricted_three_body_set_up">1</a>.</p>
<figure id="fig:restricted_three_body_set_up">
<img src="images/restricted_three_body_set_up.png" />
<figcaption>Schematic illustration of the restricted three-body setup.
The system is reduced to three interacting components: the Galaxy
(primary), the globular cluster (secondary), and a single star
(tertiary). Red vectors indicate forces that are neglected, while the
black vectors are those that we model.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This formulation dramatically simplifies the dynamics: the full <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span>-body problem is approximated by <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> independent realizations of the
restricted three-body problem. This reduction allows us to efficiently
simulate the formation and evolution of tidal features without incurring
the computational cost of tracking all mutual interactions among stars.
This approximation has been shown to work very well for certain stellar
streams and this thesis is not the first time such methods have been
employed. For instance, consider the work of <span class="citation"
data-cites="2012A&amp;A...546L...7M">Mastrobuono-Battisti et al.
(2012)</span>, who modeled the evolution of the Palomar 5’s stellar
stream with both an <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>-body code as
well as the restricted three body problem. The differences between the
two models for reproducing many characteristics of the stream are
minimal.</p>
<p>In the remainder of this section, I present the theoretical framework
underlying the simulations. At their core, the simulations involve
solving <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> sets of six coupled
ordinary differential equations—one set for each star particle.
Section <a href="#subsec:myEquationsOfMotion" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="subsec:myEquationsOfMotion">1.1</a> introduces the
equations of motion. Section <a href="#subsec:gravfield"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="subsec:gravfield">1.2</a>
describes the gravitational field used to compute the forces acting on
the particles. Finally, Section <a href="#subsec:initialconditions"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="subsec:initialconditions">1.3</a> details the procedure
used to generate initial conditions that faithfully represent a globular
cluster.</p>
<h2 id="subsec:myEquationsOfMotion">Equations of Motion</h2>
<p>In galactic dynamics, we can well describe the motion of stars
through Poisson’s equation, which extends Newton’s law of gravity from
point masses to smooth density distributions: <span
class="math display">\[\label{eq:poissonsequation}
            \nabla^2 \Phi = 4\pi G \rho,\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is the mass density and <span
class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> is the gravitational potential. We
use Newtonian mechanics throughout this work because <span
class="math inline">\(\Phi &lt;&lt; c^2\)</span> in all relevant
regimes, meaning General Relativity is not required <span
class="citation" data-cites="bovy_inprep">(see Appendix C of
<strong>bovy_inprep?</strong>)</span>. Poisson’s equation assumes
Newton’s postulate that gravitational forces act instantaneously and
that masses attract each other along the line connecting them. <a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Instead of writing down the gravitational forces through Newton’s
second law, I will write down Hamilton’s equations derived from the
variational principle of Lagrangian mechanics. The full interacting
system includes the kinetic energy of the globular cluster and the star
particle, as well as three gravitational potential energy terms: the
cluster-galaxy interaction, the particle-galaxy interaction, and the
particle-cluster interaction: <span class="math display">\[\mathcal{L} =
\frac{1}{2} M_{\rm gc} \dot{\mathbf{R}}_{\rm gc}^2
                        + \frac{1}{2} m \dot{\mathbf{r}}^2
                        - M_{\rm gc} \Phi_{\rm gal}(\mathbf{R}_{\rm gc})
                        - m \Phi_{\rm gal}(\mathbf{r})
                        - m \Phi_{\rm gc}(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{R}_{\rm
gc}).\]</span> <strong>annotate the equations</strong>. We decouple the
equations of motion of the globular cluster and the star. The
justification for this approximation is evident when we normalize the
Lagrangian by the cluster mass, <span class="math inline">\(M_{\rm
gc}\)</span>. This yields:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{\mathcal{L}}{M_{\rm gc}} =
\frac{1}{2} \dot{\mathbf{R}}_{\rm gc}^2
                                        - \Phi_{\rm gal}(\mathbf{R}_{\rm
gc})
                                        + \underbrace{\frac{m}{M_{\rm
gc}} \left[ \frac{1}{2} \dot{\mathbf{r}}^2
                                        - \Phi_{\rm gal}(\mathbf{r})
                                        - \Phi_{\rm gc}(\mathbf{r} -
\mathbf{R}_{\rm gc}) \right]}_{\text{negligible correction to GC&#39;s
motion}}\]</span></p>
<p>In the limit where <span class="math inline">\(m &lt;&lt; M_{\rm
gc}\)</span>, the terms in brackets become negligible, and the star’s
motion has no influence on the cluster. The Lagrangian for the cluster’s
orbit thus becomes:</p>
<p><span
class="math display">\[\frac{\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{gc}}}{M_{\mathrm{gc}}}
= \frac{1}{2} \dot{\mathbf{R}}_{\rm gc}^2
                                - \Phi_{\rm gal}(\mathbf{R}_{\rm
gc})\]</span></p>
<p>Switching to the star’s perspective, we normalize the Lagrangian by
the particle mass <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, obtaining:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{\mathcal{L}_{\rm star}}{m} =
\frac{1}{2} \dot{\mathbf{r}}^2
                                - \Phi_{\rm gal}(\mathbf{r})
                                - \Phi_{\rm gc}(\mathbf{r} -
\mathbf{R}_{\rm gc}(t))\]</span></p>
<p>Here, the cluster’s influence on the particle is retained through its
time-dependent position <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{R}_{\rm
gc}(t)\)</span>. This influence becomes important when the gravitational
forces from the cluster and the galaxy on the particle are comparable.
For a quick estimate, we treat both the galaxy and the cluster as point
masses. The two forces become comparable when the particle is
sufficiently close to the cluster, which occurs when: <span
class="math inline">\(|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{R}_\mathrm{GC}| &lt;
\sqrt{\frac{M_{\mathrm{gc}}}{M_{\mathrm{ gal}}}} |\mathbf{r}|.\)</span>
In other words, the cluster’s gravitational field dominates over the
galaxy’s on sufficiently small scales around the cluster — as expected.
For a quick sanity check: a typical globular cluster may have a mass of
<span class="math inline">\(10^5\, M_\odot\)</span>, while the galaxy
may be around <span class="math inline">\(10^{11}\, M_\odot\)</span>. If
the cluster is a few kiloparsecs from the galactic center, then the
cluster’s influence dominates within a region of order a few parsecs —
which checks out. A better limit is the tidal radius and is presented in
the next section.</p>
<p>Next, working in the Hamiltonian formalism often provides deeper
insight into the physics of the system. Additionally, Hamiltonian
mechanics reduces the equations of motion to a set of <span
class="math inline">\(2N\)</span> first-order differential equations,
rather than <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> second-order ones,
which is more convenient for computational integration.</p>
<p>The Hamiltonian can then be obtained via a Legendre transform: <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H} = \sum p_i \dot{q}_i -
\mathcal{L},\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is a
generic position coordinate, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is
its conjugate momentum, while <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>
indicates the coordinate of interest. If we use the <em>specific</em>
Lagrangian—normalized by the mass of the body of interest—then, in
Cartesian coordinates, the conjugate momenta reduce to the velocities:
<span class="math inline">\(p_i=\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial q}
\rightarrow p_i = v_i\)</span>. Another useful result comes from
Noether’s theorem: if a coordinate does not explicitly appear in the
Lagrangian, its conjugate momentum is conserved. All galactic potentials
considered in our simulation are axis-symmetric meaning they have
cylindrical symmetry (see next section). Since the Lagrangian does not
depend on the azimuthal angle <span
class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> in the <span
class="math inline">\(x\text{-}y\)</span> plane for the cluster’s
motion, the conservation of the <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-component of angular momentum is
conserved: <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta = L_z = \frac{\partial
\mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = R^2 \dot{\theta} =
\mathrm{constant.}\)</span></p>
<p>This conservation generally does not hold for star particles within
the globular cluster, as their dynamics are significantly influenced by
the cluster’s gravitational potential. However, once a star-particle
escapes the cluster the conservation of the z-component of the angular
momentum is recovered in the regime where their motion becomes dominated
by the galaxy’s potential.</p>
<p>Hamilton’s equations thus provide the time evolution of the momenta
and the positions. In cartesian coordaintes, the equations of motion for
the cluster are:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:equations_of_motion_cluster}

<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>-body computations, it is not too
computationally expensive to implement this for the cluster’s themselves

model each cluster as a Plummer sphere (as explained in the next

<p>The equations of motion listed above are what are used for the
experiments presented in Chapters 4 &amp; 5, respectively. The first two
sets of equations are those used when generating the streams through the
resectried three body problem, while the second set generate the streams
in a Milky Way where other globular clusters fly around and can perturb
a given stream. The next two subsections introduce the various forms
that <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> can take, followed by the
generation of the initial conditions.</p>
<h2 id="subsec:gravfield">The Gravitational Field</h2>
<p>Determining the gravitational field of the Milky Way remains an open
and complex problem. From our location within the Galaxy, it is
difficult to obtain a global perspective. Since the advent of
extragalactic astronomy and early classification efforts such as those
by <span class="citation" data-cites="1926ApJ....64..321H">Hubble
(1926)</span>, we have begun to ask what the total structure of our own
Galaxy is. Before providing a robust estimate for the global mass
distribution, some simpler questions were addressed. For example, <span
class="citation" data-cites="1927BAN.....4...91O">Oort (1927)</span>
studied the motion of stars in the local solar neighborhood and showed
that the Galaxy not only has net rotation, but also differential
rotation—as opposed to solid-body rotation.</p>
<p>The field has come a long way since then, and today we possess a
number of viable models for the Galactic gravitational potential. Much
of this progress owes to the fact that Poisson’s equation is linear:
<span class="math display">\[\label{eq:linear_poisson}
            \nabla^2 \left(a_0\Phi_0 + a_1\Phi_1 \right) = a_0 \nabla^2
\Phi_0 + a_1 \nabla^2 \Phi_1 = 4\pi G \left(a_0\rho_0
+a_1\rho_1\right),\]</span> which allows us to treat the Galaxy as a
superposition of separate components, each described by its own
potential-density pair. This decomposition enables the construction of
composite models from a collection of structural elements that are also
commonly observed in external galaxies. The Galaxy Zoo project <span
class="citation" data-cites="2008MNRAS.389.1179L">(Lintott et al.
2008)</span>, for instance, has shown that many galaxies—including our
own—share similar morphologies, justifying this modular approach.
Typical components of disc like galaxies, the Milky Way included,
are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A stellar disk,</p></li>
<li><p>A gaseous disk,</p></li>
<li><p>A dark matter halo,</p></li>
<li><p>A stellar halo,</p></li>
<li><p>A bulge,</p></li>
<li><p>A galactic bar,</p></li>
<li><p>Spiral arms.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, smaller-scale structures such as globular clusters,
giant molecular clouds, and open clusters can locally perturb the field.
Even external sources, such as the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds,
play a role by inducing measurable tidal effects on the Galaxy <span
class="citation" data-cites="2022ApJ...939....2A">(Arora et al.
2022)</span>.</p>
<p>Despite this framework, modeling remains difficult because the
structural components are not isolated. As emphasized by <span
class="citation" data-cites="2016ARA&amp;A..54..529B">Bland-Hawthorn and
Gerhard (2016)</span>, the components co-evolve within a shared
potential, meaning that even those formed separately eventually become
dynamically mixed. This interdependence implies that the potential
cannot be cleanly partitioned into independent contributions, and even
with a complete dataset, degeneracies would persist. Their review
illustrates this point by listing 37 parameter groups required to
characterize the Galaxy—including the local standard of rest, Galactic
reference frame, and the geometric and density properties of various
components—underscoring the system’s complexity.</p>
<p>The challenge is compounded by limitations in the available data. The
Gaia mission has delivered the most comprehensive survey of the Galaxy
to date <span class="citation"
data-cites="2023A&amp;A...674A...1G">(Gaia Collaboration, Vallenari, et
al. 2023)</span>, providing photometric and astrometric data for over
two billion stars and radial velocities for tens of millions <span
class="citation" data-cites="2018A&amp;A...616A..11G">(Gaia
Collaboration, Katz, et al. 2018)</span>. However, this still represents
only a small fraction of the total stellar population. The stellar mass
of the Milky Way is estimated to be approximately <span
class="math inline">\(6\times10^{10} \mathrm{M}_\odot\)</span> <span
class="citation" data-cites="2015ApJ...806...96L">(Licquia and Newman
2015)</span>, corresponding to roughly one hundred billion stars <span
class="citation" data-cites="2017MNRAS.465...76M">(see also McMillan
2017)</span>. Thus, Gaia provides 5D phase-space information for only
about 1-2% of all stars, and full 6D information for just a fraction of
a percent.</p>
<p>Moreover, the data suffer from unavoidable selection effects. As
illustrated in Fig. <a href="#fig:gaia_selection_function"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:gaia_selection_function">2</a>, which shows the
spatial distribution of stars with spectroscopic observations from Gaia
DR3, the bulk of high-quality measurements are clustered near the Sun.
This is a natural consequence of the inverse-square law for luminosity,
and it implies that any model of the Galactic potential must account for
these biases. Such limitations are likely to remain significant for the
foreseeable future.</p>

<p>In summary, while we now possess sophisticated models and rich
datasets, constructing a comprehensive and precise model of the Milky
Way’s gravitational field is still inherently difficult—constrained both
by observational incompleteness and the physical complexity of a system
in which all components are tightly coupled. Given these challenges, the
construction of a Galactic model depends on the scientific question
being asked.</p>
<p>Consider <code>TRILEGAL</code> <span class="citation"
data-cites="2005A&amp;A...436..895G">(Girardi et al. 2005)</span>. This
model aims to answer the question: if I observe the sky from a given
location with a given instrument, what do I expect to see? The focus of
these models are stellar populations. Dynamics—such as orbits or
gravitational forces—are secondary and not included in the construction.
The primary goal is to reproduce observed star counts and understand the
underlying stellar populations. Such models are designed to simulate the
sky as it would appear to missions like Hipparcos <span class="citation"
data-cites="1997A&amp;A...323L..49P">(Perryman et al. 1997)</span>,
2MASS <span class="citation" data-cites="2006AJ....131.1163S">(Skrutskie
et al. 2006)</span>, and SDSS <span class="citation"
data-cites="2000AJ....120.1579Y">(York et al. 2000)</span>.</p>
<p>Some models attempt to address both stellar populations and dynamics.
For example, the Besançon model aims to construct a dynamically
self-consistent model of the Milky Way that reproduces observables such
as the rotation curve, as well as the spatial and chemical distributions
of stars. The model originated with <span class="citation"
data-cites="2003A&amp;A...409..523R">Robin et al. (2003)</span>, who
constrained it primarily using Hipparcos data. Their initial
decomposition included a thin disk, a thick disk, a stellar halo, and a
bulge, with each component assigned its own star formation rate and
initial mass function. The model has been continuously refined; for
instance, <span class="citation"
data-cites="2022A&amp;A...667A..98R">Robin et al. (2022)</span>
incorporated Gaia DR3 kinematics to further constrain it. As noted by
<span class="citation" data-cites="2025AJ....169..317K">Klüter et al.
(2025)</span>, who recently introduced the open-source Python package
<code>SYNTHPOP</code> for simulating on-sky photometry, the success of
TRILEGAL and the Besançon model lies in their openness: they are
publicly available and have web interfaces for widespread use. These
tools are particularly valuable for creating mock surveys of the
sky.</p>
<p>A different approach is taken by <span class="citation"
data-cites="2024MNRAS.527.1915B">Binney and Vasiliev (2024)</span>,
building on <span class="citation"
data-cites="2023MNRAS.520.1832B">Binney and Vasiliev (2023)</span>, who
constructed a dynamical model of the Milky Way in which the distribution
function depends on orbital actions—quantities that are conserved along
orbits in a steady-state potential. In axisymmetric potentials, the
actions are <span class="math inline">\(J_r\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(J_\phi\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(J_z\)</span>, and represent how much motion an
orbit has in the radial, azimuthal, and vertical directions,
respectively. The moments of the distribution function yield observable
quantities such as stellar surface densities, volume densities, and
velocity dispersions. In addition to dynamical consistency, the model
includes the chemical properties of stars, specifically metallicity
([Fe/H]) and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-element
abundances. The model is constrained using Gaia DR3 data <span
class="citation" data-cites="2023A&amp;A...674A...1G">(Gaia
Collaboration, Vallenari, et al. 2023)</span>, particularly stars with
full phase-space information, as well as APOGEE DR17 <span
class="citation" data-cites="2017AJ....154...94M">(Majewski et al.
2017)</span>. Their model involves over 40 parameters to describe the
distributions of stars and metallicities throughout the Milky Way.</p>
<p>Then, there are many models of the Milky Way that are primarily
dynamically motivated, with stellar populations treated as secondary
<span class="citation"
data-cites="1991RMxAA..22..255A 2015ApJS..216...29B 2017MNRAS.465...76M 2017A&amp;A...598A..66P 2024ApJ...967...89I">(Christine
Allen and Santillan 1991; Bovy 2015; McMillan 2017; Pouliasis, Di
Matteo, and Haywood 2017; Ibata et al. 2024)</span>. Despite the
variety, their construction generally follows the same template: the
authors must choose which dataset to use, which tracer populations to
include, and the parametric form of the Milky Way potential. Often,
fitting all model parameters is infeasible, whether due to lack of data,
high computational cost, or non-converging likelihoods.</p>
<p>All of the above models assume axisymmetry, which is already a
limitation. This makes it difficult to model the dynamics in the inner
Galaxy (within <span class="math inline">\(2~\mathrm{kpc}\)</span>) or
for the most bound stars — though these are not necessary for modeling
orbits outside that region. Both <span class="citation"
data-cites="2017MNRAS.465...76M">McMillan (2017)</span> and <span
class="citation" data-cites="2024MNRAS.527.1915B">Binney and Vasiliev
(2024)</span> fix the parameters describing the gas in the Galactic disk
and only fit those related to the stellar and dark matter distributions.
<span class="citation" data-cites="2017MNRAS.465...76M">McMillan
(2017)</span> specifically constructed their model to support orbit
calculations for stars in anticipation of Gaia data releases. They aimed
to improve upon their earlier model <span class="citation"
data-cites="2011MNRAS.414.2446M">(McMillan 2011)</span>, motivated by
(1) a tripling of the maser population used to trace disk kinematics,
and (2) the realization that omitting a gaseous disk in their earlier
work had led to underestimating the forces in the solar vicinity.</p>
<p>Many of the models described above rely on fitting data using
kinematic information — comparing the model’s predictions for velocity
dispersion to observations of large samples of stars. This is because
direct astrometric measurements of stellar accelerations are still in
their infancy. Measuring changes in angular position through parallax is
so challenging that stars were long referred to as <em>fixed stars</em>
<span class="citation" data-cites="1981unht.book.....K">(Kant and Jaki
1981)</span>. Precise, year-over-year positional measurements are
required to observe motion on the celestial sphere — precisely what Gaia
does. <strong>Whose uncertainties are lower: proper motions or radial
velocities? Is it possible to measure accelerations using radial
velocities?</strong></p>
<p>That said, accelerations have been measured in some cases. <span
class="citation"
data-cites="2018ApJS..239...31B 2021ApJS..254...42B">Brandt (2018,
2021)</span> created a cross-catalog between Hipparcos and Gaia DR2
<span class="citation" data-cites="2018A&amp;A...616A...1G">(Gaia
Collaboration, Brown, et al. 2018)</span> and later EDR3. This provided
a baseline of over 25 years, long enough to detect accelerations for
some stars. However, the Hipparcos catalog only contains around 100,000
stars, and the typical acceleration of a field star in the Galaxy is
extremely small. Consequently, the cross-matched catalog is currently
being used to study stars with unusually high accelerations — typically
in binary systems or with massive planets <span class="citation"
data-cites="2023MNRAS.521.5232W 2025AJ....170...52G">(Waisberg, Klein,
and Katz 2023; Giovinazzi et al. 2025)</span> — rather than to measure
Galactic accelerations.</p>
<p>As stated in the motivation for undertaking this thesis, stellar
streams are particularly to this recovering information about the
galactic gravitational field. The stars within a stream are on similar
orbits (but shifted in phase), and their orientation and curvtature
encodes detailed information about the Galactic gravitational field.
<span class="citation" data-cites="2024ApJ...967...89I">Ibata et al.
(2024)</span> is the first study to use stellar streams to directly fit
a gravitational potential model of the Milky Way. Even in that case,
<span class="citation" data-cites="2024ApJ...967...89I">Ibata et al.
(2024)</span> fixed some of the model parameters, adopting the same
bulge model as <span class="citation"
data-cites="2017MNRAS.465...76M">McMillan (2017)</span>.</p>
<p>In this thesis, we use the model of <span class="citation"
data-cites="2017A&amp;A...598A..66P">Pouliasis, Di Matteo, and Haywood
(2017)</span>, which builds upon <span class="citation"
data-cites="1991RMxAA..22..255A">Christine Allen and Santillan
(1991)</span>. This model was developed within our research group and
made available at the start of the project. It was designed to fit
observational data similar to those used in <span class="citation"
data-cites="2015ApJS..216...29B">Bovy (2015)</span>, including the
galactic rotation curve and local stellar kinematics. <span
class="citation" data-cites="2017A&amp;A...598A..66P">Pouliasis, Di
Matteo, and Haywood (2017)</span> provides two versions of the model —
one with a bulge and one without. Below, we describe the second version,
which we used in both Chapter 4 and Chapter 5.</p>
<p>The second version of <span class="citation"
data-cites="2017A&amp;A...598A..66P">Pouliasis, Di Matteo, and Haywood
(2017)</span> models the Galaxy with a halo, and thin and thick disks.
One advantage of this model is that the gravitational potential of each
component is analytic. For example, the Miyamoto-Nagai potential <span
class="citation" data-cites="1975PASJ...27..533M">(Miyamoto and Nagai
1975)</span> is fully analytic and given by: <span
class="math display">\[\Phi(R, z \mid M, a, b) = -\frac{G M}{\sqrt{R^2 +
\left(a + \sqrt{z^2 + b^2}\right)^2}},\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is the total mass of the disk, <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is the radial scale length, and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is the vertical scale height. This form
smoothly interpolates between a flattened disk and a spherical
distribution, depending on the values of <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. <span class="citation"
data-cites="2017MNRAS.465...76M">McMillan (2017)</span> also used this
form for their disk model.</p>
<p>However, it is worth noting that real galaxies are observed to have
exponentially decaying disks: <span class="math display">\[\rho(R,z) =
\rho_0 \mathrm{exp}\left(-\frac{R}{R_d}-\frac{|z|}{z_d}\right),\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is the mass density,
<span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is the cylindrical radius, <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> the vertical height, and the model has
three parameters: a characteristic density <span
class="math inline">\(\rho_0\)</span>, scale radius <span
class="math inline">\(R_d\)</span>, and scale height <span
class="math inline">\(z_d\)</span>. A drawback of this model is that it
cannot be integrated analytically to obtain the potential, since the
<span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> coordinates are not separable. Often,
basis function expansions are needed to approximate the potential and
compute forces. <span class="citation"
data-cites="2017MNRAS.465...76M">McMillan (2017)</span> and <span
class="citation" data-cites="2024ApJ...967...89I">Ibata et al.
(2024)</span> both adopted this model for their Galactic disks.</p>
<p>Regarding the halo, <span class="citation"
data-cites="2017A&amp;A...598A..66P">Pouliasis, Di Matteo, and Haywood
(2017)</span> do not separate the dark matter and stellar halo
components. Instead, they use a single halo model to represent the total
gravitational contribution from both. This model is inherited from <span
class="citation" data-cites="1991RMxAA..22..255A">Christine Allen and
Santillan (1991)</span>, originally proposed in <span class="citation"
data-cites="1986RMxAA..13..137A">C. Allen and Martos (1986)</span>. It
is designed so that beyond a certain scale radius, the enclosed mass
grows linearly with distance, leading to the desirable feature of a flat
rotation curve: <span
class="math display">\[M_{\mathrm{enc}}(r|M_0,\gamma,r_0,r_c) = M_0
            \begin{cases}
             \frac{\left(r/r_0\right)^\gamma}{1 +
\left(r/r_0\right)^{\gamma - 1}} &amp; r&lt;r_c,\\
             \frac{\left(r_c/r_0\right)^\gamma}{1 +
\left(r_c/r_0\right)^{\gamma - 1}} &amp; r&gt; r_c,\\
            \end{cases}
            \label{eq:martos_enclosed_mass}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(M_0\)</span> is a mass scaling
parameter (not the total mass), <span class="math inline">\(r_0\)</span>
is the characteristic radius, <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is the power-law index, and <span
class="math inline">\(r_c\)</span> is a cutoff radius beyond which the
mass is held constant. Thus, for <span class="math inline">\(r &gt;
r_c\)</span>, Eq. <a href="#eq:martos_enclosed_mass"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="eq:martos_enclosed_mass">[eq:martos_enclosed_mass]</a>
yields the total mass.</p>
<p>In the outer regime <span class="math inline">\((r/r_0) &gt;&gt;
1\)</span>, the enclosed mass scales as <span class="math inline">\(M(r)
\propto r\)</span>, producing a flat rotation curve. In the inner regime
<span class="math inline">\((r/r_0) &lt;&lt; 1\)</span>, the mass grows
as a power law, <span class="math inline">\(M(r) \propto r^{\gamma -
1}\)</span>, which provides flexibility in shaping the central density
slope. Since the unmodified profile leads to an unphysical divergence in
total mass, a truncation at <span class="math inline">\(r_c\)</span> is
imposed.</p>
<p>Assuming spherical symmetry, we may use the relation <span
class="math inline">\(\nabla \Phi = \frac{G
M_{\mathrm{enc}}(r)}{r^2}\)</span>. Requiring that the potential vanish
at infinity, the corresponding gravitational potential can be obtained
by integrating: <span class="math display">\[\Phi(r|M_0,\gamma,r_0,r_c)

<p>In general, a good halo model should reproduce the observed flat
rotation curve at large radii. Another class of models that achieves
this are the double power-law profiles: <span
class="math display">\[\rho(r \mid \alpha, \beta, r_s) = \rho_0 \left(
\frac{r}{r_s} \right)^{-\alpha} \left(1 + \frac{r}{r_s} \right)^{\alpha
- \beta},\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(r_s\)</span> is a
scale radius, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> controls the
inner slope, and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> the outer
slope. Common choices include the NFW profile (<span
class="math inline">\(\alpha = 1\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\beta = 3\)</span>) and the Hernquist profile
(<span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 1\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\beta = 4\)</span>). These families of models were
implemented in the works of <span class="citation"

<p>How important is the choice of potential model when modeling the
orbits of globular clusters? It depends on the specific cluster. Take,
for instance, Fig. <a href="#fig:vasiliev_2021_EDR3_GCS_FIG_10"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:vasiliev_2021_EDR3_GCS_FIG_10">4</a>. The position
and spread of some clusters are virtually identical between different
models—for example, NGC 288. This suggests that the observational
uncertainties in the kinematic data are larger than the discrepancies
introduced by the choice of potential. However, for other clusters, the
model choice has a much greater impact. A notable case is Pyxis, where
the inferred orbits differ significantly depending on the potential.
This effect is more pronounced for clusters located farther from the
Galactic center, where the models diverge more strongly.</p>

<p>Differences in cluster orbits-or in stellar streams evolved in
different potentials-can help constrain the underlying Galactic
potential and eventually lead to more accurate models of the Milky Way.
This was the motivation behind recent work such as <span
class="citation" data-cites="2024ApJ...967...89I">Ibata et al.
(2024)</span>. However, if the goal is to make robust predictions or
extrapolate properties of the halo, it is prudent to explore a variety
of Galactic models, especially when no single model is clearly
preferred.</p>
<p>What about the self-gravity of the globular cluster itself? Here we
adopt one of the simplest available models: the Plummer sphere <span
class="citation" data-cites="1911MNRAS..71..460P">(Plummer 1911)</span>.
This model has two parameters—the total mass and a scale length—and
takes the form <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:plummer}
            \Phi(r \mid M, b) = -\frac{G M}{\sqrt{r^2 + b^2}},\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is the total mass and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is the scale length. In the limit <span
class="math inline">\(a \rightarrow 0\)</span>, the Miyamoto-Nagai
potential reduces to a Plummer sphere. This model has a minimum
potential at the center, recovers the potential of a point mass at large
distances (<span class="math inline">\(r &gt;&gt; b\)</span>), and
yields a density profile that decays as <span class="math inline">\(\rho
\propto r^{-5}\)</span> at large radii.</p>
<h2 id="subsec:initialconditions">Generating a Globular Cluster</h2>
<p>Now that we have our equations of motion established, and we have an
accurate model for computing the gravitational force at each point in
the galaxy, what are the initial conditions? First, the initial
conditions for the center’s of mass of the globular clusters, their mass
and size, are taken observationally from <span class="citation"
data-cites="2018MNRAS.478.1520B">Baumgardt and Hilker (2018)</span>.
What about the stars within the cluster?</p>
<p>We have choosen the potential for each cluster to be a Plummer sphere
from Eq. <a href="#eq:plummer" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="eq:plummer">[eq:plummer]</a>, which meanns that it is
more massive in the center and whose density decreases with a power law
beyond the characteristic radius. We can use this to obtain a mass
profile, and then sample this distribution to obtain initial positions
for each particle.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, positions alone are not enough, for we must also know
the velocities. After sampling the positions, we could do something
crude by saying that each star has a velocity vector that could point in
any direction with equal probability. This is known as being
<em>isotropic</em> or equally random. Next, we could say that a star’s
speed could be anywhere from zero to the escape velocity. While this
would work to create a set of plausible initial conditions, it would not
be <em>self-consistent</em>.</p>
<p>In galactic dynamics, a fundamental challenge is the
<em>self-consistency problem</em>. This involves a loop of three
steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Given a density distribution and a gravitational potential
(linked via Poisson’s equation), one samples the positions of
stars.</p></li>
<li><p>One then assigns initial velocities and evolves the system
forward in time.</p></li>
<li><p>The potential is updated based on the evolved mass
distribution.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If the system is in equilibrium and self-consistent, then the mass
distribution remains stable under its own gravity. That is, the same
density that generated the potential continues to persist as the system
evolves. For the rest of the section, I will describe in detail how one
creates a self consistent system through the Collisionless Boltzmann
Equation, and the simplifying assumptions employed in this thesis tackle
our specific problem.</p>
<p>Our starting point is to characterize the system statistically, with
a distribution function (DF) over phase-space. That is, what is the
probability density of finding a particle at a given position and
velocity? This is encoded in the function <span
class="math inline">\(f(\vec{x}, \vec{v}, t)\)</span>. If we treat this
as a true probability density function that integrates to 1 over all
phase space, we are implicitly assuming a closed system: no stars enter,
leave, are born, or die.</p>
<p>Already, by writing <span class="math inline">\(f(\vec{x}, \vec{v},
t)\)</span>, we are assuming that a particle’s phase-space position is
independent of any other attributes — such as mass. Let us define <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{w} = (\vec{x}, \vec{v})\)</span> as the 6D
phase-space coordinate. Then, for a system of <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> particles, the full distribution
function lives in <span class="math inline">\(6N\)</span>-dimensional
space: <span class="math display">\[f(\mathbf{w}_1, \dots,
\mathbf{w}_N)\]</span> This expression represents the joint probability
density of finding particle 1 at <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{w}_1\)</span>, particle 2 at <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{w}_2\)</span>, and so on. In general, this
object can be extremely complicated. But we can simplify it with two
strong assumptions: that particles are independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d.). This leads to:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{rl}
        f
        &amp; \stackrel{\text{(1) $N$-body DF}}{\longrightarrow}
        f(\mathbf{w}_1, \dots, \mathbf{w}_N) \\[2ex]
        &amp; \stackrel{\text{(2) independence}}{\longrightarrow}
        \prod_{i=1}^N f^i(\mathbf{w}_i) \\[2ex]
        &amp; \stackrel{\text{(3) identical
distribution}}{\longrightarrow}
        \left[ f(\mathbf{w}) \right]^N
        \end{array}\]</span></p>
<p>The consequence of this factorization is that the total DF no longer
accounts for correlations in other variables — such as mass. Therefore,
this model cannot represent mass segregation, multiple stellar
populations, or any other effects that differentiate stars. Instead, we
describe a single homogeneous population of stars, each drawn
independently from the same distribution.</p>
<p>Because of this, we can focus our attention entirely on the
single-particle DF <span class="math inline">\(f(\mathbf{w})\)</span>,
which encodes all the statistical information we need about the
system.</p>
<p>The next key assumption is that particles are uncorrelated not just
in identity, but dynamically — they do not scatter off one another. This
means the system is <em>collisionless</em>. The DF then evolves under
the Collisionless Boltzmann Equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{Df}{Dt} = \frac{\partial
f}{\partial t} + \dot{\mathbf{x}} \cdot \nabla_{\mathbf{x}} f +
\dot{\mathbf{v}} \cdot \nabla_{\mathbf{v}} f = 0\]</span></p>
<p>This is a material (Lagrangian) derivative following a phase-space
trajectory. The physical interpretation is that the DF is conserved
along the orbits of stars in phase space. No bunching up, no spreading
out — stars simply move under the influence of a smooth, mean
gravitational potential.</p>
<p>Next, we often impose the equilibrium condition: <span
class="math display">\[\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} = 0\]</span> This
implies that the DF is time-independent: the number of stars at any
given phase-space location remains constant. If some leave a region,
others must replace them. This assumption is only valid in isolation —
for instance, in an isolated galaxy or globular cluster. It is violated
during mergers or tidal disruptions. In my simulations, I model such
disruptions, so this assumption is not globally valid. However, I begin
with an equilibrium system and study how it departs from equilibrium
numerically.</p>
<p>Now, let us focus on globular clusters. These are often modeled as
spherically symmetric systems. However, spherical symmetry in density
does not imply isotropy in velocity. A system can be spherically
symmetric but have velocity anisotropy, meaning that orbits are
preferentially radial or circular. This is quantified by the anisotropy
parameter <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>. In my simulations,
I assume isotropy, meaning that the DF depends only on the energy <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span>. Thus, we write:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(\mathbf{w}) = f(E)\]</span></p>
<p>At this point, it is useful to mention Jeans equations, which relate
the moments of the DF to observable quantities. By integrating the DF
over all velocities, we recover the spatial mass density:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\rho(\mathbf{r}) = M \int f(\mathbf{x},
\mathbf{v}) \, d^3\mathbf{v}\]</span></p>
<p>In fact, an inversion formula exists — known as the Abel transform —
that allows one to reconstruct <span class="math inline">\(f(E)\)</span>
from a known <span class="math inline">\(\rho(r)\)</span>. This
technique is presented in <span class="citation"
data-cites="2008gady.book.....B">Binney and Tremaine (2008)</span> and
<span class="citation"
data-cites="bovy_inprep">(<strong>bovy_inprep?</strong>)</span>. At this
point, one can obtain a complete analytic expression for the
distribution function. For a Plummer sphere, this distribution function
is <span class="math inline">\(f = C (-E)^{7/2}\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is a constant that ensures <span
class="math inline">\(\int f dE =1\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="sampling-the-initial-conditions">Sampling the Initial
Conditions</h3>
<p>There are many techniques for sampling from a distribution function.
In my code, I use <em>inverse transform sampling</em>, a method that
facilitates sampling from one-dimensional probability distribution
functions.</p>
<p>Although the full distribution function depends on six
variables—three positions and three velocities—it can be marginalized
such that we treat each variable independently. This allows us to apply
inverse transform sampling to each component separately.</p>
<p>Inverse transform sampling works by first constructing the cumulative
distribution function (CDF) of the desired probability distribution
function (PDF):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathcal{F}(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{x}
f(x&#39;)\,dx&#39;.\]</span></p>
<p>By definition, the probability that a random variable <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is less than a given value <span
class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> is given by the value of the CDF at
<span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathcal{P}(x &lt; x_0) =
\mathcal{F}(x_0).\]</span></p>
<p>Since CDFs are monotonically increasing and invertible, we also
have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{F}(x) &lt;
\mathcal{F}(x_0)) = \mathcal{P}(x &lt; x_0).\]</span></p>
<p>Now, consider a uniform random variable <span
class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> distributed on the interval <span
class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span>. Then,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathcal{P}(Y &lt; \mathcal{F}(x_0)) =
\mathcal{P}(x &lt; x_0),\]</span></p>
<p>which implies:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[x = \mathcal{F}^{-1}(Y).\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, we can generate samples from the target PDF <span
class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> by applying the inverse CDF <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}^{-1}\)</span> to uniformly distributed
random numbers. This is practical, since uniform random number
generators—such as <code>numpy.random.rand</code>—are widely
available.</p>
<p>The probability distribution for an isotropic Plummer sphere depends
only on the energy, which itself depends on a particle’s radial distance
and speed: <span class="math inline">\(f(r,v) \propto
(-E)^{7/2}\)</span>. If we marginalize over the velocities, we obtain
the one-dimensional density profile. The CDF of this marginalized
distribution is the enclosed mass as a function of radius. For a Plummer
sphere, it takes the form: <span
class="math display">\[M_{\mathrm{enc}}(r) = \frac{r^3}{\left(1 +
r^2\right)^{3/2}},\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(M_{\mathrm{enc}}\)</span> is normalized to the
total mass and <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is normalized to
the characteristic radius.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:inverse_transform_sampling_distances"
data-reference-type="ref"

demonstrates inverse transform sampling applied to this CDF.
Intersections between uniform random numbers and the CDF are computed;
these intersections yield the sampled radial distances.</p>

<figcaption>Inverse transform sampling of the enclosed mass distribution
of a Plummer sphere. One thousand uniform random numbers between [0,1]
were generated and intersected with the normalized enclosed mass
profile. The top panel shows the sampling of positions; only 100 samples
are shown to avoid overcrowding. The bottom panel shows the resulting
distribution of radial distances.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The joint distribution function can be written as the product of a
conditional and a marginal distribution: <span
class="math inline">\(f(r,v) = f(v|r) f(r)\)</span>. The number of
particles at a given speed can be obtained by integrating over the
angular velocity components and differentiating with respect to speed:
<span class="math display">\[\frac{dN}{dv} = \frac{d}{dv} \int
f(\textbf{v}|r)\, v^2 \sin\theta\, d\theta\, d\phi\, dv = 4\pi v^2
f(v|r).\]</span></p>
<p>To construct the CDF of this conditional distribution, we must
determine the appropriate limits. The allowed speed for a particle at
radius <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> ranges from zero to the
escape speed, <span class="math inline">\(v_{\mathrm{esc}} =
\sqrt{2\Phi(r)}\)</span>. The resulting CDF is: <span
class="math display">\[\mathcal{F}(v) = C \int_0^{v &lt; v_\mathrm{esc}}
4\pi v^2 f(v|r) dv,\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is a normalization constant. Although I
do not present an analytical expression for <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, it is straightforward to normalize
numerically. In practice, I omit multiplicative constants and normalize
a posteriori using: <span class="math display">\[C =
\frac{1}{\mathcal{F}(v_\mathrm{esc})}.\]</span></p>
<p>Sampling the speeds is shown in Fig. <a
href="#fig:inverse_transform_sampling_velocities"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:inverse_transform_sampling_velocities">6</a>. Since
this is a conditional distribution, each particle has its own CDF based
on its position—unlike Fig. <a
href="#fig:inverse_transform_sampling_distances"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:inverse_transform_sampling_distances">5</a>, where
all particles are sampled from the same marginal distribution. Note that
for particles located farther from the center, fewer speeds are
available before they become unbound.</p>
<figure id="fig:inverse_transform_sampling_velocities">
<img src="images/inverse_transform_sampling_velocities.png" />
<figcaption>Inverse transform sampling of the speed distribution
conditioned on position for particles in a Plummer sphere (<span
class="math inline">\(N = 1000\)</span>). The top panel shows 25 samples
(to avoid clutter), each colored by its sampled distance. For each
particle, a uniform random number is mapped onto its corresponding CDF
to obtain the speed. The bottom panel shows the distribution of sampled
speeds. The theoretical maximum value, corresponding to the escape speed
at the center, is <span
class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2GM/r_c}\)</span>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This process could be inverted: one could marginalize over position
to obtain a global speed distribution, then condition on speed to sample
positions. While valid, this approach is less intuitive. Most models are
motivated by their density profiles, which are observable and
conceptually accessible, making them a natural starting point for
inverse transform sampling.</p>
<p>To convert radial distances into 3D positions, and speeds into
velocity vectors, we must sample directions uniformly over the surface
of a sphere. A common pitfall is to sample latitude and longitude
uniformly, which leads to an over-density near the poles. Instead, we
aim for a uniform distribution over the sphere’s surface, where the
differential area element is given by: <span
class="math display">\[f(\theta,\phi)=\frac{1}{4\pi}\sin(\theta)\]</span>
with <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> the co-latitude and
<span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> the longitude. Since <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> does not depend on <span
class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>, it can be sampled uniformly over
its domain <span class="math inline">\([0, 2\pi)\)</span>. However, for
<span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, inverse transform sampling
must be used. Drawing a uniform random variable <span
class="math inline">\(y_i \in [0,1]\)</span>, the corresponding
co-latitude is: <span class="math display">\[\theta_i =
\cos^{-1}\left(1-2y_i\right).\]</span></p>
<p>By sampling radial distances, speeds, and directions uniformly over
the unit sphere, we obtain full position and velocity vectors for each
particle. With these, the initial conditions for a Plummer sphere are
fully specified. The user need only provide the total mass,
characteristic radius, and the desired number of star particles.</p>
<p>With the equations of motion defined, a model for the galactic
gravitational field established, a force model for the globular cluster
in place, and initial conditions assigned to each star particle, we are
now ready to simulate the tidal disruption of a globular cluster in the
Galaxy.</p>
<h1 id="the-implicit-physics">The Implicit Physics</h1>
<p>The previous section provided everything needed to simulate the
dissolution of globular clusters. However, given the equations of
motion, the model for the gravitational field, and the initial
conditions for both the globular clusters and their constituent stars,
why should we expect stars to escape? While the formalisms in the
previous section supply the necessary machinery for running simulations,
they do not explain <em>why</em> disruption occurs.</p>
<p>In this section, I aim to describe the underlying mechanisms that
cause stars to escape from globular clusters and form stellar streams.
Gaining intuition for this process involves simplifying the equations
<em>even further</em>, in order to obtain analytical insights. I refer
to this as the <em>implicit physics</em>—not because it was explicitly
implemented in the simulations, but because it arises naturally from the
equations that be.</p>
<p>To provide a brief overview: I begin with the circular restricted
three-body problem, the simplest formalism for understanding the kinds
of motion a massless body can undergo when influenced by two much more
massive ones. I then introduce the tidal tensor, which describes how and
why the galactic field eventually strips stars from their host clusters.
After that, I discuss phase mixing, which explains the evolution of
escaped stars and how they come to form coherent stellar streams. This
also helps explain the divergence of orbital solutions over time, which
is particularly relevant for the work in Chapter 5, where we investigate
whether the globular cluster system can affect the Palomar 5 stream.
Finally, I introduce <em>gapology</em>—the study of how perturbations
can impact a stream and generate observable gaps within it.</p>
<h2 id="the-planar-circular-restricted-three-body-problem">The Planar
Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem</h2>
<p>This section introduces the fundamental concept of the Lagrange
points and regions of influence. In general, if a star is very close to
the center of mass of a globular cluster, then its dynamics are
determined by the cluster and the galaxy’s influence is minimal. On the
otherhand, if the star is far from the cluster then its motion is
completely describe by the galaxy’s gravitational field and the cluster
is completely negligible. The Lagrange points are transitions between
these two regime and are the points out of which the stars escape from
the cluster. The magic that makes this analysis possible is decoupling
the motion of the smallest body from the larger two, and studying the
system in a non-inertial reference frame.</p>
<p>To begin, even though we simplify the simulation by modeling the
cluster as <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{N}\)</span> independent
three-body problems, the problem remains challenging. Indeed, if we
consider all three bodies to have mass, we can write down a Hamiltonian
with 18 dimensions: three positions and three momenta in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{R}^3\)</span> for each particle. The
dimensionality of the problem can be reduced by using the conservation
of total linear momentum and total angular momentum, and by expressing
the dynamics in terms of relative coordinates about the system’s center
of mass. This reduces the total dimensionality to 9. Nevertheless, the
problem remains analytically intractable due to its high dimensionality.
To gain analytical insight, we simplify the system further.</p>
<p>Instead of writing the full Lagrangian for the three-body motion, we
focus on the third particle subject to the gravitational influence of
the two massive bodies, in an inertial reference frame centered at the
system’s center of mass. The Lagrangian then contains the kinetic energy
of the third particle and two gravitational potential energy terms from
the primary and secondary. However, since the positions and momenta of
the primaries are not treated as dynamical variables in our system, they
appear as explicit functions of time, making the Lagrangian
non-autonomous. This implies that the corresponding Hamiltonian is
time-dependent and the total energy of the third particle is not
conserved, as the primaries can exchange energy with it.</p>
<p>We introduce a further simplifying assumption: the two primaries move
on circular orbits. Under this assumption, we transform to a reference
frame rotating with the primaries, placing them along the <span
class="math inline">\(x-\)</span>axis. In this rotating frame, the
Lagrangian becomes autonomous; it no longer depends explicitly on time
and requires no external information to determine the particle’s
subsequent motion.</p>
<p>Two effects make this possible. First, by moving to the rotating
frame, we introduce non-inertial forces: the Coriolis force and the
centrifugal force. The centrifugal force is conservative, associated
with a scalar potential. The Coriolis force depends on the particle’s
velocity as <span class="math inline">\(2\omega\times v\)</span>, but
because it is always perpendicular to the velocity, it does no work and
thus does not change the particle’s kinetic energy. After performing the
coordinate transformation, the canonical momenta—now
position-dependent—can be derived. The resulting Hamiltonian is: <span
class="math display">\[\mathcal{H} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\left(p_x + \omega
y\right)^2 + \left(p_y - \omega x\right)^2 \right) +
\Phi_\mathrm{eff}(x,y),\]</span> where <span
class="math display">\[\Phi_\mathrm{eff}(x,y) = -\frac{1}{2} \omega^2
(x^2 + y^2) - \frac{G m_1}{|r_1|} - \frac{G m_2}{|r_2|}.\]</span></p>
<p>The potential can be normalized by noting that the orbital angular
velocity from the two-body problem satisfies <span
class="math inline">\(\omega^2 = \frac{G M}{a^3}\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is the separation between the primaries
and <span class="math inline">\(M = m_1 + m_2\)</span> is the total mass
of the system. With this normalization, the system depends on a single
dimensionless parameter <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, the
relative mass ratio defined as <span class="math inline">\(\mu =
\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\)</span>.</p>
<p>At this point, the system can be studied qualitatively.
Unfortunately, no general closed-form solution exists for the circular
restricted three-body problem that describes the subsequent motion as a
function of time. However, by studying the effective potential <span
class="math inline">\(\Phi_\mathrm{eff}\)</span>, we gain valuable
insights.</p>
<p>Our Hamiltonian depends on the four variables <span
class="math inline">\((x, y, p_x, p_y)\)</span> and has one integral of
motion.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> A famous quantity in this context is
the Jacobi integral (or Jacobi constant), often written as <span
class="math inline">\(C_j = -2E\)</span>. Defining this constant is
somewhat arbitrary since the total mechanical energy <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is itself conserved, and any scalar
multiple of it is also conserved. The utility of the Jacobi constant is
mostly conventional: it is often defined to be positive and multiplied
by 2, which simplifies the expression for forbidden regions and
zero-velocity curves. For example, one can write <span
class="math display">\[\dot{x}^2 + \dot{y}^2 = 2 \Phi_\mathrm{eff}(x,y)
+ C_j,\]</span> instead of the equivalent <span
class="math display">\[\dot{x}^2 + \dot{y}^2 = -2 \Phi_\mathrm{eff}(x,y)
+ 2E.\]</span></p>
<p>Since we have four variables and one constraint, the motion is
restricted to a three-dimensional hypersurface (or manifold) embedded in
the four-dimensional phase space.</p>
<p>At this stage, we find the points where <span
class="math inline">\(\nabla \Phi_\mathrm{eff} = 0\)</span>, which
correspond to the Lagrange points—locations where all effective forces
balance. Of particular importance are the first two Lagrange points
<span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span>, which lie along the line connecting
the primary and secondary. The effective potential at <span
class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> is lower than at <span
class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Given a certain energy level, setting the kinetic energy to zero
defines boundaries between regions where the particle can and cannot
move. Regions where the kinetic energy would have to be negative (which
is physically impossible) are forbidden, since that would require
imaginary velocities.</p>
<p>The points <span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> are especially important for our
study of a globular cluster with stars initially bound to it. Stars can
escape through these Lagrange points: lower-energy particles tend to
escape through <span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span>, while
higher-energy particles can also escape through <span
class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span>. Figure <a

Each plot is shown in the non-inertial reference frame rotating with the
orbital frequency of the primary and secondary about their common center
of mass. In this example, the mass ratio is <span
class="math inline">\(m_1 = 10 m_2\)</span>. The gray regions represent
areas inaccessible to the test particle for a given energy. In the first
case, where <span class="math inline">\(E &lt; E_1\)</span>, the
particle remains confined to orbit either around the primary or the
secondary, depending on its initial position. As the particle’s energy
increases, more of the <span class="math inline">\(xy\)</span>-plane
becomes accessible. The narrow passage between <span
class="math inline">\(m_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(m_2\)</span> corresponds to the <span
class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> Lagrange point, while the choke point
allowing escape to the exterior when <span class="math inline">\(E &gt;
E_2\)</span> is the <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span>
point.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The distance from the secondary to the first and second Lagrange
points is approximately equal, defining a region around the secondary
known as the Hill sphere. Within this zone, the gravitational influence
of the secondary dominates over that of the primary. The Hill radius is
commonly approximated as <span class="math inline">\(r_h \approx
r\sqrt[3]{m_2/m_1}\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is the separation between the
primaries. Interestingly, the expression for the Hill radius arises from
a fifth-order polynomial expansion of the effective potential—a detail
that might seem minor, but is actually quite delightful. In most areas
of physics, approximations typically emerge from Taylor expansions,
basis function decompositions, or limits where the governing equations
simplify.</p>
<p>At conferences, we have been asked whether we have ever observed
<em>recapture</em>—that is, a star particle leaving a globular cluster
and eventually returning. If the system were as simple as the circular
restricted three-body problem, recapture could occur for star particles
with energies in the range <span class="math inline">\(E_1 &lt; E &lt;
E_2\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(E_2 &lt; E &lt;
E_3\)</span>. In such cases, depending on initial conditions, a particle
might orbit the secondary, escape, and later return.</p>
<p>However, in our simulations, the galaxy and globular clusters are not
treated as point masses, and the clusters follow eccentric, inclined,
and non-closed orbits. This means the topology of the forbidden region
evolves over time. For a particle with a given energy <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, it may be unbound at one moment but
later find itself within the Hill sphere again, as the potential
landscape changes dynamically. Indeed, we have observed such behavior in
our simulations.</p>
<p>The Lagrange points, forbidden regions, and Jacobi energy are
powerful concepts which, while they do not rigorously apply in our more
complex setup, still offer valuable qualitative insights. In our regime,
it is more fruitful to think in terms of tidal forces as the underlying
mechanism that gradually transfers energy and angular momentum, nudging
stars across Lagrange boundaries and ultimately enabling escape. It is
to this process—tidal stripping—that we now turn.</p>
<h2 id="tidal-forces">Tidal Forces</h2>
<p>For star-particles within a globular cluster that is itself orbiting
within a galaxy, there are no exact integrals of motion. The system
lacks symmetries in its Lagrangian, and the potential varies with time,
so even the orbital energy is not conserved. In such a time-dependent
and asymmetric context, it is more insightful to frame the problem in
terms of forces rather than conserved quantities. In particular, tidal
forces arise when the gravitational field of the galaxy (the primary) is
treated as an external perturbation to the field of the globular cluster
(the secondary). In this section, I aim to build an intuitive and formal
understanding of tidal forces, framing them as tensor quantities. We
begin with the simplest case—the familiar Sun-Earth system—before
extending the discussion to the galactic context. I also provide a
broader overview of how tidal forces vary depending on the cluster’s
orbit within the galaxy.</p>
<p>To start, tidal forces arise due to spatial variations in the
gravitational field with respect to a reference point, which is almost
always the secondary body. There are two equivalent optiosn to quanitfy
this. The first is to consider a Taylor expansion of the gravitational
potential of the primary, <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_g\)</span>,
evaluated at the star’s position <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{x}_s\)</span>, relative to the secondary’s
position <span class="math inline">\(\vec{x}_c\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[\Phi_g\left(\vec{x}_s\right) \approx
\Phi_g\left(\vec{x}_c\right) + \left[\nabla \Phi_g (\vec{x}_c)\cdot
\Delta \vec{x}\right] + \left[\Delta \vec{x} \cdot
\mathcal{D}^2\left(\Phi_g\right) \cdot \Delta\vec{x}\right],\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \vec{x} = \vec{x}_s -
\vec{x}_c\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{D}^2
\Phi_g\)</span> is the Hessian matrix of second derivatives of the
potential: <span class="math inline">\(\partial^2 \Phi/\partial x_i
\partial x_j\)</span>.</p>
<p>the second expression can be derived by linearizing the gravitational
force in a non-inertial frame co-moving with the secondary. Let us write
Newton’s second law for the star-particle and the secondary in an
inertial frame: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
            \vec{F}_s &amp;= \nabla \Phi_c\left(\Delta \vec{x}\right) +
\nabla \Phi_g\left(\vec{x}_s\right),\\
            \vec{F}_c &amp;= \nabla \Phi_g\left(\vec{x}_c\right).
        
\end{aligned}\]</span> Then the relative acceleration of the star in the
non-inertial frame is: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
            \vec{f}_s &amp;= \vec{F}_s - \vec{F}_c +
\vec{F}_\mathrm{fictitious} \\
                    &amp;= \nabla \Phi_c\left(\Delta \vec{x}\right) +
\nabla \Phi_g\left(\vec{x}_s\right) - \nabla
\Phi_g\left(\vec{x}_c\right) + \vec{F}_\mathrm{fictitious} \\
                    &amp;\approx \nabla \Phi_c\left(\Delta
\vec{x}\right) + \mathrm{Jac}\left(\nabla \Phi_g(\vec{x}_c)\right) \cdot
\Delta \vec{x} + \vec{F}_\mathrm{fictitious},
        
\end{aligned}\]</span> where the last line uses a first-order Taylor
expansion of the gravitational force field, valid under the assumption
that <span class="math inline">\(|\Delta \vec{x}| &lt;&lt;
|\vec{x}_c|\)</span>.</p>
<p>The Jacobian of the gravitational field is equal to the Hessian of
the potential, owing to the symmetry of second derivatives and the fact
that <span class="math inline">\(\vec{g} = -\nabla \Phi_g\)</span>. This
matrix, known as the <em>tidal tensor</em> <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{T}\)</span>, describes the linearized
spatial variation of the gravitational field: <span
class="math display">\[\mathcal{T} = -\mathcal{D}^2\Phi_g =
\mathrm{Jac}(\nabla \Phi_g) = \left(\begin{matrix}
                \partial_x g_x &amp; \partial_y g_x &amp; \partial_z g_x
\\
                \partial_x g_y &amp; \partial_y g_y &amp; \partial_z g_y
\\
                \partial_x g_z &amp; \partial_y g_z &amp; \partial_z g_z
            \end{matrix}\right).\]</span></p>
<p>While the Hessian and Jacobian are formally equivalent, the Jacobian
viewpoint offers a more geometric interpretation: it acts as a linear
transformation on nearby displacements, mapping them to differences in
acceleration. Diagonalizing the tidal tensor reveals the principal axes
of tidal deformation. A positive eigenvalue corresponds to stretching
along the associated eigenvector; a negative eigenvalue indicates
compression. The magnitude gives the rate of stretching or
compression.</p>
<p>Finally, we note that although many relevant potentials exhibit
spherical or cylindrical symmetry, Cartesian coordinates are preferred
here. In curvilinear systems, computing the Jacobian or Hessian requires
accounting for Christoffel symbols, which complicates the interpretation
and computation.</p>
<h3 id="the-moon">The Moon</h3>
<p>Nothing clarifies the concept of tides like the most familiar
example: the Moon. Tidal forces are invoked to explain a wide range of
phenomena in the Earth-Moon system. The most relatable effect is, of
course, the periodic variation in sea level on Earth. While accurately
modeling these changes requires fluid dynamics—beyond the scope of this
thesis—NASA provides several accessible explanations and visualizations
at <a
href="https://science.nasa.gov/moon/tides/">https://science.nasa.gov/moon/tides/</a>,
including daily high and low tides, as well as spring and neap
tides.</p>
<p>Another key example is the tidal deformation of the Moon, which
ultimately led to its tidal locking—explaining why we always see the
same side of the Moon from Earth.</p>
<p>A particularly insightful illustration is the angular offset between
the Earth’s tidal bulge and the Moon’s position, caused by the Earth’s
rotation. This offset results in a torque that transfers angular
momentum from the Earth’s rotation to the Moon’s orbit. As a
consequence, Earth’s rotation gradually slows while the Moon slowly
recedes from Earth.</p>
<p>All of the above phenomena requires using the tidal tensor for a
Keplerian potential: <span class="math display">\[\mathcal{T}=
-\frac{GM}{r^3}\left(\begin{matrix}
                    1-\frac{3x^2}{r^2} &amp; -\frac{3xy}{r^2} &amp;
-\frac{3xz}{r^2} \\
                    -\frac{3yx}{r^2} &amp; 1-\frac{3y^2}{r^2} &amp;
-\frac{3yz}{r^2} \\
                    -\frac{3zx}{r^2} &amp; -\frac{3zy}{r^2} &amp;
1-\frac{3z^2}{r^2}
                \end{matrix}\right),\]</span> which has eigenvalues
<span class="math inline">\(2\frac{GM}{r^3}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(-\frac{GM}{r^3}\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(-\frac{GM}{r^3}\)</span>, with corresponding
eigenvectors: <span class="math display">\[\vec{v}_1,\vec{v}_2,\vec{v}_3
= \dfrac{1}{r}\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix},
\dfrac{1}{r}\begin{bmatrix} -x \\ y \\ 0 \end{bmatrix},
\dfrac{1}{r}\begin{bmatrix} -x \\ 0 \\ z \end{bmatrix}.\]</span></p>
<p>Notably, the first eigenvalue is positive and corresponds to a
stretching deformation along the position vector. The other two are
negative, representing compression in directions perpendicular to the
stretching axis. These directions define a plane orthogonal to the
Earth-Moon line.</p>
<p>From this, several tidal effects become evident. For instance, the
Earth’s oceans stretch along the Earth-Moon axis due to the Moon’s tidal
forces. While the Sun also exerts tidal forces on Earth, their magnitude
is weaker due to the <span class="math inline">\(r^{-3}\)</span> scaling
with distance. When the Moon is either full or new, the Sun and Moon’s
tidal forces act constructively, leading to spring tides. At first and
third quarters, they interfere destructively, causing neap tides.
Additionally, Earth’s tidal influence distorts the Moon from spherical
symmetry into an ellipsoid. The Moon’s most stable orientation is one
where its longest axis aligns with the Earth-Moon line—resulting in
tidal locking.</p>
<p>A more quantitative treatment of these phenomena would require
modeling the Moon’s internal structure and Earth’s ocean dynamics—well
beyond the gravity-only scope of this thesis. However, we can still
explore one instructive effect: how solar tidal forces <em>perturb</em>
the Moon’s orbit away from the idealized two-body Earth-Moon
configuration. Figure <a href="#fig:moon_tidal_simulation"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:moon_tidal_simulation">8</a> shows a toy model
comparing two scenarios. In both, I used initial conditions based on JPL
NASA ephemerides <span class="citation"
data-cites="2014IPNPR.196C...1F">(Folkner et al. 2014)</span> and
integrated two sets of equations of motion. Neglecting solar tides
causes the predicted Moon orbit to drift ahead of the more accurate
trajectory. With about three to four years, the two body predicted
solution would off by half a moon phase.</p>
<p>In the first scenario, the Moon’s motion is governed by the two-body
Earth-Moon problem with a rotating reference frame correction: <span
class="math display">\[\ddot{\vec{r}} = -\frac{GM_\oplus}{r^3}\vec{r} -
\omega_\oplus \times \left(\omega_\oplus \times
\vec{r}_\oplus\right),\]</span> while in the second, we include the
effect of solar tidal forces: <span
class="math display">\[\ddot{\vec{r}} = -\frac{GM_\oplus}{r^3}\vec{r} -
\omega_\oplus \times \left(\omega_\oplus \times \vec{r}_\oplus\right)
-\frac{GM_\odot}{r_\oplus^3}
                \left(\begin{matrix}
                    1-\frac{3x^2}{r_\oplus^2} &amp;
-\frac{3xy}{r_\oplus^2} &amp; -\frac{3xz}{r_\oplus^2} \\
                    -\frac{3yx}{r_\oplus^2} &amp;
1-\frac{3y^2}{r_\oplus^2} &amp; -\frac{3yz}{r_\oplus^2} \\
                    -\frac{3zx}{r_\oplus^2} &amp;
-\frac{3zy}{r_\oplus^2} &amp; 1-\frac{3z^2}{r_\oplus^2}
                \end{matrix}  \right) \cdot \vec{r},\]</span> where
<span class="math inline">\(r_\oplus\)</span> is the Earth’s position

<h3 id="tides-from-the-disk">Tides from the disk</h3>
<p>In the Milky Way, the disk, bulge, and halo each contribute
differently to the tidal forces experienced by a globular cluster. The
Miyamoto-Nagai disk produces strong, rapidly varying tidal fields near
the Galactic plane, leading to phenomena such as disk shocking when
clusters cross the disk. The Martos halo, on the other hand, provides a
more slowly varying, generally weaker tidal field at large
Galactocentric radii.</p>
<p>The strength and orientation of the tidal field at a cluster’s
location determine both the rate at which stars are stripped and the
geometry of the resulting stellar streams. For example, clusters on
eccentric or inclined orbits experience time-dependent tidal forces,
with strong compressive shocks during disk crossings and enhanced
stretching near pericenter. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the
tidal tensor at each point along the orbit reveal the principal axes of
stretching and compression, which in turn set the directions along which
stars are most likely to escape.</p>
<p>By computing the tidal tensor for the Miyamoto-Nagai disk and Martos
halo potentials, as shown below, we can visualize and quantify these
effects. The following figures illustrate how the tidal field evolves
for representative orbits, highlighting the interplay between the
cluster’s trajectory and the Galactic mass distribution. This analysis
underpins our understanding of stream formation and the morphological
diversity of observed tidal tails.</p>
<p>We can construct the tidal tensor for the Miyamoto-Nagai potential.
First, it is convenient to non-dimensionalize the potential. Below, we
normalize the potential by the total mass and gravitational constant,
<span class="math inline">\(\Phi\prime = \Phi / (GM)\)</span>, and each
distance by the characteristic length of the disk, <span
class="math inline">\(x\prime = x/a\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(b\prime = b/a\)</span>. For clarity, we omit the
prime notation in what follows. The dimensionless potential then
becomes: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
                \Phi   &amp;= \frac{1}{D},\\
                D       &amp;= \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + \beta^2(z)},\\
                \beta(z)   &amp;= 1 + \sqrt{z^2 + b^2}.
            
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The dimensionless tidal tensor is then: <span
class="math display">\[\mathcal{T}=-\frac{1}{D^3}\left(\begin{matrix}
                    1-\frac{3x^2}{D^2} &amp; -\frac{3xy}{D^2} &amp;
-\frac{3x\beta \beta&#39;}{D^2} \\
                    \dots &amp; 1-\frac{3y^2}{D^2} &amp; -\frac{3y\beta
\beta&#39;}{D^2} \\
                    \dots &amp; \dots &amp; \beta&#39;^2 + \beta
\beta&#39;&#39; -\frac{3\left(\beta\beta&#39;\right)^2}{D^2}
                \end{matrix}\right).\]</span></p>
<p>We immediately notice that, due to the cylindrical symmetry, the
eigenvectors are not as simple as in the spherical case. As long as
<span class="math display">\[\beta&#39;^2 + \beta \beta&#39;&#39; -
\frac{3\left(\beta \beta&#39;\right)^2}{D^2} \neq 1 -
\frac{3z^2}{D^2},\]</span> (1) the stretching axis is no longer parallel
to the position vector, and (2) the compression axes do not necessarily
lie in the same plane—they may instead be fixed in orientation and
differ in magnitude. The exact orientation of all three eigenvectors
depends on the cluster’s position in the galaxy. Note that if <span
class="math inline">\(z = 0\)</span>, we recover the case where the
stretching eigenvector is parallel to the position vector, although the
compression axes remain unequal in magnitude and fixed in orientation.
If instead <span class="math inline">\(b = 0\)</span>, then we recover
spherical symmetry, and the compression eigenvalues become equal.</p>

<p>Given spherical symmetry, the we expect the tidal tensor of the halo
to be similar to that of a keplerian tidal tensor. Perhaps the magnitude
of the tidal forces will not scale as simply with <span
class="math inline">\(\propto r^{-3}\)</span>, since the mass is not
concentrated in a single point. However, we can still expect the
stretching axis to be parallel with the position vector.</p>
<p>To explore this, first we rewrite the mass distribution of the Martos
halo: <span class="math display">\[M&#39;_\text{enc}(s) =
\frac{s^\gamma}{1+s^{\gamma-1}}\]</span> From Poisson’s equation in
spherical symmetry: the force is: <span class="math inline">\(\nabla
\Phi = - M_\mathrm{enc}/r^2\)</span>. The dimensionless tidal tensor can
be written as: <span class="math display">\[\mathcal{T&#39;}=
-\frac{M&#39;_\text{enc}(s)}{s^3}\left(\begin{matrix}
                    1-\frac{x^2}{s^2}f(s) &amp; -\frac{xy}{s^2}f(s)
&amp; -\frac{xz}{s^2}f(s) \\
                    -\frac{yx}{s^2}f(s) &amp; 1-\frac{y^2}{s^2}f(s)
&amp; -\frac{yz}{s^2}f(s) \\
                    -\frac{zx}{s^2}f(s) &amp; -\frac{zy}{s^2}f(s) &amp;
1-\frac{z^2}{s^2}f(s)
                \end{matrix}\right)\]</span> where <span
class="math display">\[f(s) = 2-\frac{\gamma-1}{1+s^{\gamma-1}}.
                \label{eq:martos_f_s}\]</span></p>
<p>While exploring this tidal tensor, I came across an interesting area
of the parameter space, that I would like to show here.</p>
<p>Taking the Martos tidal tensor in Eq. <a href="#eq:martos_f_s"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="eq:martos_f_s">[eq:martos_f_s]</a>, we can see that for
<span class="math inline">\(\gamma &gt; 3\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(s &lt;  1\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(f(s)&lt; 0\)</span>. Physically, this would be a
sphere whose density increases with distance. This is not natural, as,
in general, gravity sends the more massive objects towards the center.
However, it’s fun to indulge in this situation to learn some insight
about the flexibility of tidal fields. The consequence of <span
class="math inline">\(f(s)&lt; 0\)</span> is that all terms in the tidal
tensor are negative, which means that the force is compressive
everywhere. Consequently, no stars escape from the cluster.</p>
<p>In Fig. <a href="#fig:martos_tidal_field_small_r"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:martos_tidal_field_small_r">14</a>, I present a
small experiment demonstrating the consequence of such a tidal force on
a globular cluster, which is that no tidal stream forms. Briefly, I
created a plummer sphere of <span
class="math inline">\(10^6\)</span> M<span
class="math inline">\(_\odot\)</span> and half mass radius 20 pc and
evolved it in a Martos halo potential of mass parameter <span
class="math inline">\(10^{12}\)</span> M<span
class="math inline">\(_\odot\)</span> a characteristic radius of <span
class="math inline">\(30\)</span> kpc. Each cluster was placed at the
same initial conditions, a distance of 1/4 the scale radius from the
center of the potential. The initial velocity was made perpendicular to
the position vector with a speed of <span
class="math inline">\((1-e)v_\textrm{c}\)</span>. This is a
pseudo-eccentricity, which was added to have a non-circular orbit to
demonstrate how the trajectories change in the two cases. The top panel
uses a <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> of 2.02, which is the
same value in the model where the halo was originally presented, and the
value I employ in this thesis. Next, the bottom panel uses <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> of 4.5, which corresponds to a
density profile where <span class="math inline">\(\rho(r) \propto
r^{1.5}\)</span>.</p>
<p>To get a feel for the strength of the tidal stretching and
compression, I show a circle and the resulting ellipse after applying
the tidal deformation. I computed the coordinates of the ellipse by
adding <span class="math inline">\(\vec{Ell} = \vec{C} + \frac{1}{2}
t_\textrm{char}^2 \mathcal{T}\cdot \left(\vec{C} -
\vec{r_o}\right)\)</span>. This way, force can be mapped to position
space, and the strengths of the tidal forces can be seen visually. The
characteristic time, <span
class="math inline">\(t_\textrm{char}\)</span>, was set to <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{10} 2\pi r_\textrm{halo} /
v_\textrm{c}\)</span>.</p>

<p>In the case of Fig. <a href="#fig:martos_tidal_field_big_r"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:martos_tidal_field_big_r">15</a>, the tidal field
returns to the typical situation where one axis is compressive and the
other stretches. Notice how the deformations are similar in magnitude,
while in the case of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma=2.02\)</span>
for the top panel of Fig. <a href="#fig:martos_tidal_field_small_r"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:martos_tidal_field_small_r">14</a>, the compression
is stronger than the expansion. Both of these are different than the
keplerian tidal deformation where the stronger deformation is stretching
and whose axis is parallel to the position vector.</p>
<h2 id="the-distribution-of-escaped-stars">The Distribution of Escaped
Stars</h2>
<p>Tidal forces cause stars to escape from the Lagrange points of the
globular cluster. As we’ve seen, these forces can be compressive—pushing
stars toward the cluster—or stretching—pulling them away, and
specifically toward the Lagrange points. The stretching component is
significantly amplified during pericenter passages, causing many stars
to escape in bursts.</p>
<p>This process doesn’t fling stars into intergalactic space. Rather,
the galactic tidal field is typically weak compared to the cluster’s own
gravitational pull, and escaping stars gain just enough energy to leave
the cluster. As a result, they are still on very similar orbits to the
clusters once they escape.</p>
<p>But once stars escape, why do they form coherent stellar streams? And
do they do anything else? To answer this, I must first introduce the
concept of <em>phase mixing</em>. This naturally leads us to discuss the
range of possible orbits a globular cluster can follow, given
observational uncertainties. I’ll cover this fully before returning to
the topic of stellar streams, which will be much easier to understand
once this groundwork is in place.</p>
<p><em>Phase mixing</em> is a direct consequence of Liouville’s theorem,
which follows from the collisionless Boltzmann equation. Liouville’s
theorem states that the infinitesimal volume element in phase space,
<span class="math inline">\(d\mathbf{p}\,d\mathbf{q}\)</span>, is
preserved under Hamiltonian evolution. In other words, the phase-space
density <span class="math inline">\(f(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p},
t)\)</span> remains constant along a particle’s trajectory.</p>
<p>To visualize this, instead of considering a single infinitesimal
element, imagine a small cloud of initial conditions centered around
<span class="math inline">\((\mathbf{q}_0, \mathbf{p}_0)\)</span>, with
spread <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_q\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma_p\)</span>. While the total 6D volume of
this cloud, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_q^3 \sigma_p^3\)</span>,
remains constant, differences in momentum cause the particles to move
through phase space at different rates. Particles with higher momenta
advance more quickly, while those with lower momenta lag behind. This
leads to the cloud stretching and dispersing, even as its total volume
is conserved. Since solutions to Hamilton’s equations are unique, this
dispersion reflects how nearby trajectories gradually diverge and spread
over the available phase space—a process we call phase mixing.</p>
<p>We can estimate the timescale for this spreading by considering how
long it takes for orbits with slightly different energies to drift apart
in phase. For example, in a Keplerian potential, the orbital period is
given by <span class="math display">\[T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2
a^3}{GM},\]</span> which depends on the semi-major axis, and thus on
energy. In general, orbits in non-Keplerian potentials are not closed;
particles precess and eventually fill out invariant tori in phase space.
A characteristic timescale for this process can be estimated by
dimensional analysis as <span class="math display">\[T_\mathrm{char} = C
\frac{GM}{E^{3/2}},\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is a constant and <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is the specific orbital energy.</p>
<p>Consider now two nearby particles with energies <span
class="math inline">\(E - \Delta E\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(E + \Delta E\)</span>. Their orbital frequencies
differ by: <span class="math display">\[\Delta f = \frac{1}{T( E -
\Delta E)} - \frac{1}{T(E + \Delta E)}.\]</span> The time required for
the faster particle to lap the slower one in phase is the <em>phase
mixing time</em>, which is the inverse of the difference <span
class="math inline">\(2\pi / \Delta f\)</span> and is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[T_\mathrm{mix} = \frac{2\pi}{\Delta f} =
\frac{2\pi T_1 T_2}{T_2 - T_1}.\]</span></p>
<p>For small energy differences <span class="math inline">\(\Delta E
&lt;&lt; E\)</span>, we can expand the period in a Taylor series to
first order. This leads to:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[T_\mathrm{mix} \approx T_\mathrm{char}
\cdot 2\pi \left( \frac{E}{3 \Delta E} \right),
            \label{EQ:phase_mixing}\]</span> Thus, the phase mixing time
grows inversely with the relative energy spread in the population.</p>
<h3 id="orbital-drift">Orbital drift</h3>
<p>The first manifestation of phase mixing is the growth of uncertainty
in orbital solutions for globular clusters over time. This originates
from the initial spread in orbital energies caused by observational
uncertainties. In Fig.<a
href="#fig:phase_mixing_palomar_5_orbital_solutions"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:phase_mixing_palomar_5_orbital_solutions">16</a>, I
present an example based on Palomar 5, for which I compute 50 orbital
solutions in our potential model. These initial conditions are sampled
according to the uncertainties reported in the Baumgardt catalog. The
figure shows that while the orbital solutions remain broadly similar,
the lower-energy orbits progress through phase space more rapidly. In
the bottom panel, the rightmost side includes overplotted dots
indicating the final <span class="math inline">\((t, z)\)</span>
coordinates of each solution, illustrating that they span nearly the
full range of <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> values allowed by
the initial conditions. In essence, once the integration time exceeds
the phase-mixing timescale, any individual solution becomes speculative:
the system could plausibly occupy any location in phase space permitted
by the initial conditions.</p>

<figcaption>Phase mixing of Palomar 5’s orbital solutions in the
<code>Pouliasis2017pii</code> potential. We sample 50 different initial
conditions based on the observational uncertainties in distance, radial
velocity, and proper motions. Each orbital solution is color-coded by
its initial total orbital energy <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>.
The top six panels show snapshots of the positions in the <span
class="math inline">\(xy\)</span>-plane of the orbital solutions at
different times. The bottom panel shows the evolution of the <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> coordinate as a function of time. Black
vertical bars mark the timestamps corresponding to the snapshots in the
top panels, which are labeled with matching alphabetical
identifiers.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>By inspecting Eq.<a href="#EQ:phase_mixing" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="EQ:phase_mixing">[EQ:phase_mixing]</a>, we note that if
the phase-mixing time is normalized by the characteristic orbital time,
the resulting dimensionless mixing time is inversely proportional to the
uncertainty in orbital energy. This relationship is general and holds
for all orbits, regardless of their periods. However, it is still
illustrative to examine this behavior in the context of the globular
cluster catalog. In Fig.<a
href="#fig:phase_mixing_orbital_errors_sample" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:phase_mixing_orbital_errors_sample">17</a>, I
present the phase-mixing times for all Galactic globular clusters, based
on current uncertainties from the Gaia DR3 catalog. The top panel shows
the distribution for all 165 clusters. The bottom panels highlight the
mixing behavior in cylindrical radius for a selection of statistically
representative clusters: Gran 1, which has the shortest mixing time;
Gran 5, the median case; NGC 6752, whose mixing time is closest to the
mean; and NGC 2419, which has the longest mixing time.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasize that these estimates are highly
model-dependent. In some cases, the models predict phase-mixing
timescales exceeding the age of the Universe. Unsurprisingly, the
phase-mixing time correlates with the orbital period, which itself is
related to the cluster’s distance from the Galactic center. At large
Galactocentric distances, the gravitational potential of the Milky Way
becomes increasingly uncertain, as observational constraints on the
Galactic mass distribution are weaker–See Fig. <a
href="#fig:vasiliev_2021_EDR3_GCS_FIG_10" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:vasiliev_2021_EDR3_GCS_FIG_10">4</a> <span
class="citation" data-cites="2021MNRAS.505.5978V">(Vasiliev and
Baumgardt 2021)</span>. Therefore, these extreme mixing times should not
be interpreted as implying that we can predict the phase-space location
of certain clusters with high confidence over cosmological
timescales.</p>
<figure id="fig:phase_mixing_orbital_errors_sample">

for globular clusters, computed using Eq. <a href="#EQ:phase_mixing"

four rows illustrate the phase-mixing behavior for four selected
clusters over the time range considered in this experiment. Orbital
solutions are color-coded by their normalized deviation from the mean

</figure>
<p>It’s also interesting to note how the uncertainties in the orbital
energy relates to the uncertainties in each observable. In Fig. <a

data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:energy_sensitivity_analysis_MWGCS_to_distance_RV_mu">18</a>,
I perform this quick calulation. The uncertainties are measured in
Galactic coordinates the ICRS coordinate system. This is a direct
transformation to Galactic coordinates and thus can be expressed
analytically.</p>

<figcaption>An analysis on the spread in orbital energies of the
globular cluster population for each of its reported uncertainties. Each

specific variable. So the top left allows the distances to vary but

against the distance. The clusters are color-coated by their mean
energies.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In short, the phase-mixing time for a given set of orbital solutions
and the uncertainty in the initial conditions can be interpreted as:
“how long until I have no idea where this cluster is?” Beyond this
timescale, the cluster’s position has an equal probability of being
anywhere in phase-space permitted by its integrals of motion. This
concept will be important in Chapter 5, where we assess whether
different possible orbits for the globular clusters could have brought
them into contact with the Palomar 5 stream.</p>
<h3 id="mixing-of-tidal-debris">Mixing of tidal debris</h3>
<p>A cloud of points together in phase-space that are initially tightly
packed together and then subsequently drift apart from one another, is a
great analogy for the evolution of stars that escape from globular
clusters to subsequently create stellar streams. For instance, at first
glance, Fig. <a href="#fig:phase_mixing_palomar_5_orbital_solutions"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:phase_mixing_palomar_5_orbital_solutions">16</a>
might give the impression that we are looking at snapshots of a single
stellar stream at different times. In reality, the figure shows
different orbital solutions. This visual similarity underscores that
both phenomena—stellar streams and diverging orbital solutions—are
manifestations of phase mixing.</p>
<p>However, there is an important distinction. The divergence of
different orbital solutions is an exact instantiation of the Louiville
theorem. The particles have no influence on one another and they are all
independently orbiting within the gravitational field. For stars within
a globular cluster, the analogy breaks down because globular clusters
are self-gravitating systems: stars interact gravitationally and remain
bound for a significant time. This self-gravity slows down the mixing
process. The time it takes for a globular cluster to dissolve and
distribute its stars uniformly in phase space is typically longer than
the idealized mixing time given by Eq. <a href="#EQ:phase_mixing"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="EQ:phase_mixing">[EQ:phase_mixing]</a>. Nevertheless,
phase mixing still governs the long-term behavior of tidally escaped
stars.</p>
<p>Importantly, we need not consider all particles within the cluster to
characterize the distribution of tidal debris as phase mixing. For
clusters with short orbital mixing times compared to the simulation
duration, stars that escape during the simulation can redistribute
throughout the available phase space. While the resulting debris will
not be uniformly distributed—an overdensity will remain at the cluster
location—the tidal debris will broadly fill the phase space accessible
to it. This point is crucial for the results discussed in Chapter 4.</p>
<p>In fact, this can be seen in another <span class="citation"

class="citation" data-cites="2024ApJ...976...54P">Pearson et al.

clusters. However, since they dissolve, there could have been many more.
Thus, there could be many streams in the galaxy that are from now

are unassociated to globular clusters <span class="citation"

<p><span class="citation" data-cites="2024ApJ...976...54P">Pearson et

two metrics. The first, is the distance from the “center-of-mass” of a
stream from the galactic-center in galactic coordinates. This metric is:
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta_0 =
\sqrt{\mathrm{medn}(b)^2+\mathrm{medn}(l)^2}\)</span>. The argument

appears incoherrent, the stars are still moving along the same

<p><strong>What about the</strong> actions for classifying the
streams?</p>
<h2 id="massive-objects-colliding-with-stellar-streams">Massive objects
colliding with stellar streams</h2>
<p>Previous we described how they escape the globular clusters. Then we
described how the escaped stars can redistribute themselves in the
galaxy following a nice evolutionary flow in the gravitational field
from normal hamiltonian evolution. However, other things can happen to
the stream. Notably, other massive objects in the galactic field can
fly-by and perturb the orbits of some of these stars. Here, I would ike
to summarize this.</p>
<p>Collisions are essential in this thesis for two reasons. Firstly, one
of the main research questions is how the passage of a subhalo perturbs
a stellar stream. This interaction can be treated as a gravitational
collision.</p>
<p>In general, we are interested in how much the momentum of a particle
changes before and after the encounter. We can simplify the scenario by
assuming that the target particle is initially at rest, and that the
perturber (the subhalo) flies by with a minimum distance of approach
<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>—the <em>impact
parameter</em>.</p>
<p>Since both objects exert gravitational forces on each other, the
target will gain energy and begin to move, while the perturber will be
slightly deflected and slow down. However, to simplify the calculation,
we assume the perturber is unperturbed by the target—i.e., it moves on a
straight-line trajectory with constant speed <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span>.</p>
<p>In this approximation, we compute the momentum change of the target
by integrating the gravitational force over time. Gravity is always
attractive: the perturber pulls the target particle to the left before
the closest approach and to the right afterward. If the trajectory is
symmetric and unperturbed, the components of the force parallel to the
motion cancel out. Thus, the net momentum transfer is perpendicular to
the motion of the perturber.</p>
<p>Assume the perturber moves along the <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis with impact parameter <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, and the target lies at the origin.
Then the net force acts in the <span class="math inline">\(+y\)</span>
direction. The gravitational force scales as <span
class="math inline">\(1/d^2\)</span>, so for distances <span
class="math inline">\(d &gt;&gt; b\)</span>, the force becomes
negligible. We can then approximate the force as roughly constant over a
short time interval during the closest approach.</p>
<p>We estimate the duration of the interaction as the time it takes the
perturber to travel a distance <span class="math inline">\(2b\)</span>
(from <span class="math inline">\(x = -b\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(x = +b\)</span>), giving <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta t = 2b/v\)</span>. Assuming a constant
perpendicular force <span class="math inline">\(F_\perp \approx
GMm/b^2\)</span>, the change in momentum is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
        m\,\delta v_y &amp;=&amp; \int F_\perp \, dt \\
                    &amp;\approx&amp; F_\perp \cdot \Delta t \\
                    &amp;=&amp; \frac{GMm}{b^2} \cdot \frac{2b}{v}
        
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Dividing both sides by <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, the
change in velocity is: <span
class="math display">\[\label{eq:delta_v_impulse_approx}
        \delta v_y = \frac{2GM}{b v}\]</span></p>
<p>It is interesting to note that this result is inversely proportional
to the velocity of the perturber. This behavior contrasts with contact
collisions, where a higher speed typically results in a greater momentum
transfer. In gravitational encounters, a faster flyby leads to a shorter
interaction time and thus less momentum exchange.</p>
<h3 id="gapology">Gapology</h3>
<p>Gaps in stellar streams are underdensities that appear after
encounters with dark matter subhalos or globular clusters. These can be
understood as resulting from collisions. However, modeling the
interaction as one point mass hitting another is too simplistic. What
happens when an extended object, like a subhalo, interacts with a
continuous stellar stream? Before delving into the technical details, it
is worth clarifying a misconception–one that I myself held when first
approaching this problem. Encounters between stellar streams and
perturbers are not violent collisions in which stars are physically
ejected or stripped from the stream. Rather, the perturber imparts a
small, localized change in velocity to nearby stars, subtly altering
their orbital periods. Over time, these tiny shifts accumulate, causing
stars to drift apart and gradually sculpting a visible underdensity: the
gap.</p>
<p>To address this, we turn to the work of <span class="citation"
data-cites="2015MNRAS.450.1136E">Erkal and Belokurov (2015)</span>, who
studied a simplified model: a stream with uniform density on a circular
orbit. This idealized setup allows for an analytical treatment of the
gap’s formation and evolution. A gap can be characterized by two main
quantities: its angular width, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta
\theta\)</span>, and the density contrast, <span
class="math inline">\(\rho_{\mathrm{peak}}/\rho_0\)</span>, between the
overdensities at the gap’s edges and the central underdensity.</p>
<p>To understand how these evolve, the authors derived a
parameterization of the change in velocity <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta \vec{v}\)</span> for stars along the stream
after a perturbation. This vector function depends on the position <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> along the stream relative to the impact
point and on several parameters describing the perturber and the impact
geometry: <span class="math display">\[\Delta \vec{v} = f(y \,|\, M,
r_s, b, w_\parallel, w_\perp, \alpha),\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is the impactor’s mass, <span
class="math inline">\(r_s\)</span> its scale radius, <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> the impact parameter, <span
class="math inline">\(w_\parallel\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(w_\perp\)</span> the components of its velocity
parallel and perpendicular to the stream, and <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> the angle between the impactor’s
trajectory and the <span class="math inline">\((x,z)\)</span>-axes.</p>
<p>To set up the problem, a coordinate system is defined where the
stream lies along the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis, and
the impact occurs at <span class="math inline">\(y=0\)</span>. Because
the stream has spatial extent, the impactor’s motion must be decomposed
into parallel and perpendicular components with respect to the stream.
Unlike the simpler point-mass approximation, here <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta \vec{v}\)</span> generally has nonzero
components in all directions. In particular, <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta v_y\)</span> alters the speed along the
stream, while <span class="math inline">\(\Delta v_x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta v_z\)</span> displace stars out of the
stream’s plane. <span class="math inline">\(\Delta v_x\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta v_z\)</span> can be zero if the trajectory
of the impactor is parallel to the <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> axis or <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> axis, respectively.</p>
<p>The expression for <span class="math inline">\(\Delta v_y\)</span>
is: <span class="math display">\[\Delta v_y\left(y\,|\, M, r_s, b,
w_\parallel, w_\perp\right) = - \frac{2GM w_\perp^2 y}{w\left[\left(b^2
+ r_s^2\right)w^2 + w_\perp^2 y^2\right]},\]</span> which is an odd
function of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, as expected for a
gravitationally attractive force: stars ahead of the impact point (<span
class="math inline">\(y&gt;0\)</span>) are slowed down, while those
behind (<span class="math inline">\(y&lt;0\)</span>) are sped up.</p>

<figcaption>The change in velocity, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta
v_y\)</span>, of stars along the stream after an impact. The stream lies

<span class="math inline">\(\Delta v_y\)</span>, its location, and the

data-cites="2015MNRAS.450.1136E">Erkal and Belokurov
(2015)</span>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Several assumptions underlie this formulation. First, the stream is
approximated as a straight line, which requires the size of the impacted
region to be much smaller than the orbital circumference. Second, the
velocities of both the stream and the perturber are assumed constant,
implying that the duration of the impact is much shorter than the
system’s orbital period. These assumptions also imply that the impactor
must pass close to the stream and be compact relative to the stream’s
orbital radius.</p>
<p>The authors then developed the time evolution of the stream’s density
following the impact. To study these, the authors employed three
complementary approaches:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>A numerical solution of a transcendental equation governing <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta \theta(t)\)</span>;</p></li>
<li><p>A fully analytic solution for a low-order analytical
approximation valid when the gap opening <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta \theta\)</span> is still small;</p></li>
<li><p>An <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>-body simulation of the
full system.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Together, these revealed three distinct phases of gap evolution:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Compression phase</strong> – Shortly after the impact,
stars on opposite sides swap places, briefly compressing the stream
until the right and left sides overtake one another.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Linear growth phase</strong> – The gap grows roughly
linearly in time, as stars move apart under their velocity
differences.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Caustic phase</strong> – Eventually, stars bunch up at
different locations at the edges of the gap, creating sharp overdensity
features (“caustics”). Additionally, the gap’s growth to is slowed to a
sublinear rate, scaling roughly as <span class="math inline">\(\propto
\sqrt{t}\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The author’s make an important realization. Even in a scenario where
the galactic potential and the stream’s orbit are known, with just the
gap’s density profile there are still seven parameters that describe
it’s shape: <span
class="math inline">\(M,r_s,b,w_\perp,w_\parallel,\alpha,t\)</span>. The
authors state that the gap’s profile provide two more piece of
information and with a constraint on the perturber’s density, we would
still be left with four degrees of freedom. The problem is thus
underdetermined and it is thus impossible to uniquely determine the
properties of the perturber. A large statistical sample of gaps would be
required to constrain a population of dark matter subhalos. With the
ever increasing data quality, perhaps this could be possible
someday.</p>
<p>While powerful, the authors describe how the limiting assumptions
impact the interpretations of this work. First, the framework is limited
to circular orbits which poses a significant constraint especially for
globular clusters which often have inclined and eccentric trajectories.
Indeed, as they discussed in their work, streams do not have uniform
densities. Stars that populate the streams come from tidally disrupting
stellar systems. As they leave the cluster and enter the stream, they
come with a range of energies and and angular momenta that in essence
eliminate any casutic features.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="2016MNRAS.457.3817S">Sanders,
Bovy, and Erkal (2016)</span> expanded on this foundation and provided a
truly exchaustive and comprehensive exploration of stream-subhalo
interactions. Their primary methodological innovation was the
development of a framework for modeling the impact of dark matter
subhaloes on cold, thin streams in angle-frequency space. This space
significantly simplifies stream dynamics, allowing for the rapid
generation of general stream models and proving ideal for incorporating
velocity perturbations from subhaloes. They developed methods to compute
velocity, angle, and frequency kicks for general subhaloes and impact
geometries, then translated these into angle and frequency
perturbations. This framework allowed for an extensive range of
experiments:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Various perturber models</strong>: <span class="citation"
data-cites="2016MNRAS.457.3817S">Sanders, Bovy, and Erkal (2016)</span>
compared velocity kicks produced by various astrophysically relevant
subhalo profiles, including Plummer, Hernquist, truncated
Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), and non-truncated NFW profiles. They found
that while there are differences in kick amplitudes depending on the
profile, the absolute differences between these methods were generally
small, especially for lower-mass impacts, suggesting the simpler "curved
approximation" (which accounts for stream curvature but assumes fixed
relative velocity during flyby) is often sufficient</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Different Orbits for the Progenitor</strong>: key
advancement was the focus on streams formed from progenitors on
eccentric orbits. This directly addressed a limitation of <span
class="citation" data-cites="2015MNRAS.450.1136E">Erkal and Belokurov
(2015)</span>, which primarily restricted its analysis to streams on
circular orbits. The angle-frequency space formalism is particularly
well-suited for modeling these more complex, realistic eccentric stream
dynamics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Different Impact Points</strong>: The study thoroughly
investigated how the stream changes depending on where along the stream
the impact occurs. They simulated impacts both close to the progenitor
(where particles are more mixed in energy) and further downstream (where
particles are better ordered by energy), finding that the growth rate of
the gap depends on the impact location.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Drawing from these comprehensive investigations, <span
class="citation" data-cites="2016MNRAS.457.3817S">Sanders, Bovy, and
Erkal (2016)</span> reached several essential conclusions and insights
into “gapology”:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Dominance of Frequency Kicks</strong>: They found that
angle perturbations from a flyby are generally only significant on short
timescales (less than a radial period). At later times, the frequency
perturbations become much more important, controlling the future
structure of the gap. These frequency perturbations are simply related
to the velocity perturbations (specifically, the change in energy, <span
class="math inline">\(v \cdot \delta v_g\)</span>) in scale-free
potentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gap Growth and Density Plateau</strong>: While <span
class="citation" data-cites="2015MNRAS.450.1136E">Erkal and Belokurov
(2015)</span> predicted gap growth slowing to a <span
class="math inline">\(t^{1/2}\)</span> rate in the caustic phase and the
central density decreasing as <span
class="math inline">\(t^{-1}\)</span>, <span class="citation"
data-cites="2016MNRAS.457.3817S">Sanders, Bovy, and Erkal (2016)</span>
observed that the minimum gap density eventually plateaus in time. This
plateau value decreases with increasing subhalo mass and is attributed
to the stream’s non-zero velocity dispersion, allowing upstream material
to fill in the gap, and the non-uniform unperturbed stream
density.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact Location Affects Growth Rate</strong>: They
discovered that gaps formed far downstream grow more rapidly than those
closer to the progenitor. This is because stream members far from the
progenitor are more "ordered" by energy, leading to an already growing
underlying stream structure that enhances gap formation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For many of the experiments, the authors cross validate the
semi-analytic formalism against NBody simulations and present truly
robust results. Below, I want to show how one can understand a 1D
stream.</p>
<p>To first order, a stellar stream can be modeled as a
<em>collisionless</em>, non-accelerating ensemble of stars — i.e., a
one-dimensional <em>streaming</em> solution to the collisionless
Boltzmann equation. In this case, the equation simplifies to:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + v
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 0,\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(f(x,v,t)\)</span> is the
phase-space distribution function. We assume the initial condition <span
class="math inline">\(f(x,v,t=0) = 0\)</span>, and a boundary condition
of a constant source at <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(0,v,t) = g(v \,|\, v_0, \sigma_v) =
\mathcal{N}(v \,|\, v_0, \sigma_v),\]</span></p>
<p>i.e., a Gaussian ejection velocity distribution centered at <span
class="math inline">\(v_0\)</span> with dispersion <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma_v\)</span>. The total flux amplitude is
arbitrary here.</p>
<p>Using the method of characteristics, we find that <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is constant along lines of the form
<span class="math inline">\(x - vt = \text{const}\)</span>. This means
we are solving a PDE in the <span class="math inline">\((x,t)\)</span>
plane for fixed values of <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>. The
initial condition implies that <span class="math inline">\(f=0\)</span>
in regions not yet reached by any particles — that is, wherever <span
class="math inline">\(x/t &gt; v\)</span>. Thus, the solution is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(x,v,t) =
                \begin{cases}
                    \mathcal{N}(v \,|\, v_0, \sigma_v) &amp; \text{if }
v &gt; \frac{x}{t}, \\
                    0 &amp; \text{otherwise}.
                \end{cases}
                \label{eq:one_dimensional_collisionless_streaming}\]</span></p>
<p>We can now compute the moments of this distribution. The density at
each position is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\rho(x,t) = \int_{x/t}^{\infty} f(x,v,t)
\, dv = \frac{1}{2} \, \mathrm{erfc}\left( \frac{x/t -
v_0}{\sqrt{2}\sigma_v} \right),\]</span></p>
<p>i.e., the integral of a truncated Gaussian. Similarly, the <em>mean
velocity</em> and <em>velocity dispersion</em> at fixed <span
class="math inline">\((x,t)\)</span> are computed from the conditional
distribution <span class="math inline">\(f(v|x,t) =
f(x,v,t)/\rho(x,t)\)</span>, via:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
                \langle v \rangle(x,t) &amp;= \frac{1}{\rho(x,t)}
\int_{x/t}^\infty v f(x,v,t) \, dv, \\
                \langle v^2 \rangle(x,t) &amp;= \frac{1}{\rho(x,t)}
\int_{x/t}^\infty v^2 f(x,v,t) \, dv, \\
                \sigma_v^2(x,t) &amp;= \langle v^2 \rangle(x,t) -
\langle v \rangle(x,t)^2.
            
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Each of these integrals can be expressed analytically in terms of the
error function and exponential functions, since they are the moments of
a truncated Gaussian.</p>
<p>In Fig. <a href="#fig:collisionless_1D_stream"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:collisionless_1D_stream">21</a>, I show a plot of
the <em>density</em>, <em>mean velocity</em>, and <em>velocity
dispersion</em> as a function of position at a given time. The figure
illustrates how the leading edge of the stream (larger <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>) contains only the fastest particles
and thus has a lower density and higher average velocity. Conversely,
the trailing regions have a broader mix of velocities and higher local
dispersion.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> I would love to explore this more rigorously in the
context of time-dependent or eccentric mass loss, where the source term
becomes periodic. I did begin studying such a model using a
time-dependent Gaussian source, but at some point the “simple approach”
becomes as complex as full numerical simulations.</p>
<h1 id="sec:ignoredphysics">The Ignored Physics</h1>
<p>Of course, this section could be extremely large since not all of
physics are relevant for this problem. Schrodinger’s equation, or
maxwells equation are irrelvant. But that’s not the point of this
section. In the previous two sections I wanted to present our methods
and justify that they are appropriate to gain insight to stellar streams
emerging from galactic globular clusters. In this section, I want to lay
out the landscape of what we’re missing and other techinques presented
in the literature. The most important of which is certainly handing the
globular cluster as a collisional system.</p>
<p>Make some notes on the time evolution of the Milky Way’s
gravitational field. Say that, instead of considering this to be
<em>ignored</em>, it’s on the too-do list. The most important thing that
I want to comment on is the internal dynamics of the globular clusters
since I previece this to be the main limited factor in terms of
interpretability of our results. ….</p>
<h2 id="sec:collisionalDynamics">Globular Cluster Internal Dynamics</h2>
<p>In this thesis, globular clusters are the <em>source</em> for stellar
streams, because we are interested in stellar streams more than we are
interseted in the globular clusters. We simplified the orbits of stars
within clusters to feel the mean-field, knowing full well that this is a
limiting assumption. We traded computational speed for accuracy.
However, how much of a limiting assumption is this? In essence, by
simplifying the dynamics of the globular cluster with a test-particle
method, we are limiting our models fidelity of how many star-particles
escape at any unit time, how they are ejected, and which stars go where.
Below, I would like to present a basic demosntration of two-body
relaxation and then summarize other papers that explore these works a
little bit.</p>
<h3 id="two-body-relaxation-time-a-derivation-and-example">Two-body
Relaxation Time: a derivation and example</h3>
<p>While it is appropriate to treat the orbits of stars in galaxy as
collisionless, this approximation breaks down in the context of globular
clusters. Here, I present a brief numerical experiment to illustrate the
concept of two-body relaxation, which quantifies the breakdown of the
mean-field approximation.</p>
<p>Two-body relaxation asks: how long does it take for the discrete,
granular nature of the stellar medium to cause a star’s trajectory to
deviate significantly from the one it would follow in a perfectly smooth
(mean-field) potential? This timescale is defined by the condition:
<span class="math inline">\(\delta v / v_0 \sim 1\)</span>, meaning that
the change in the velocity due to the medium roughly the original
speed.</p>
<p>In this context, we simplify the star’s motion, neglecting the
complexity of orbital paths in a galaxy. Instead, we consider uniform
motion through a medium composed of discrete masses. If the medium
consists of many small-mass particles, the potential is smoother and
better approximates the mean field. If there are fewer particles with
larger mass, each interaction can cause a significant deflection.</p>
<p>For a single interaction in the impulse approximation, the change in
velocity is: <span class="math display">\[\delta \mathbf{v} =
\frac{Gm}{bv} \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ \cos\theta \\ \sin\theta
\end{bmatrix},
                \label{eq:delta_v_vec_impulse_approx}\]</span> where
<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is the impact parameter, <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> the perturber’s mass, <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span> the relative velocity, and <span
class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> the angle in the transverse plane.
These impulses deflect the star sideways but not along the direction of
motion — a key assumption in the impulse approximation.</p>
<p>Now consider not just one fly-by, but a sequence of them. A real
galaxy has a radially decreasing density, so a star never sees a
symmetric distribution unless it’s exactly at the center — but we are
interested in fluctuations from the mean field, not the mean field
itself. That is, if <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_\mathrm{MW} =
\Phi_\mathrm{mean}(\vec{r}) +
\Phi_\mathrm{stochastic}(\vec{r})\)</span>, we are isolating the
stochastic part.</p>
<p>To simplify further, we idealize the galaxy as a cylinder of radius
and length <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, with uniform number
density <span class="math inline">\(n = N_p / (\pi R^3)\)</span>. As the
star moves through this medium, we apply Eq. <a
href="#eq:delta_v_vec_impulse_approx" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="eq:delta_v_vec_impulse_approx">[eq:delta_v_vec_impulse_approx]</a>
to compute cumulative velocity kicks. This is demonstrated numerically
in Fig. <a href="#fig:twoBodyRelaxation" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:twoBodyRelaxation">22</a>.</p>
<figure id="fig:twoBodyRelaxation">

</figure>
<p>To perform this experiment, I normalize units such that <span
class="math inline">\(G = M = R = t_\mathrm{cross} = 1\)</span>, giving
<span class="math inline">\(v_0 = 1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(m = M/N_p\)</span>. For Fig. <a

<p>At each timestep <span class="math inline">\(dt\)</span>, a
cylindrical volume <span class="math inline">\(\pi R^2 v dt\)</span> is
populated with a Poisson-sampled number of particles, where the expected
number is <span class="math inline">\(\langle N_{p,\mathrm{disc}}
\rangle = n \pi R^2 v dt\)</span>. Each particle contributes a velocity
kick via Eq. <a href="#eq:delta_v_vec_impulse_approx"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="eq:delta_v_vec_impulse_approx">[eq:delta_v_vec_impulse_approx]</a>,
which is summed over time to compute the net velocity and
trajectory.</p>
<p>I would like to present some key steps in the theoretical derivation.
In this idealized model, we expect: <span class="math display">\[\langle
\delta \mathbf{v} \rangle = \mathbf{0},\]</span> since the medium is
isotropic and random, so kicks cancel on average. However, the mean
squared change is non-zero: <span class="math display">\[\left\langle
\delta v^2 \right\rangle \neq 0.\]</span> <span
class="math inline">\(\left\langle \delta v^2 \right\rangle\)</span> can
be found by reasoning on the number of expected interactions from each
shell of a cylinder, where the volume infinitesimal is: <span
class="math inline">\(rd\theta dr(vdt)\)</span>. We find that this
<em>diffusion</em> grows linearly with time, and its rate of change
gives the two-body relaxation timescale: <span
class="math display">\[\tau_\mathrm{2-body} = \frac{v_0^2}{\frac{d
\left\langle \delta v^2 \right\rangle}{dt}}.\]</span></p>
<p>Another key in this derivation is the Coulomb integral, which
involves a logarithmic divergence: <span class="math display">\[\int
\frac{1}{R} \, dR.\]</span> We must regularize this with appropriate
limits. The upper limit is the system size (no perturbers beyond this).
The lower limit corresponds to where the impulse approximation breaks
down — I choose the distance at which a star becomes gravitationally
bound to the perturber, though this is generous and the impulse
approximation breaks down at larger distances.</p>
<p>The resulting expression for the two-body relaxation time is: <span
class="math display">\[\tau = t_\mathrm{cross} \, \frac{N}{8
\ln(N/2)}.\]</span></p>
<p>Let’s apply this to globular clusters using their catalog values.
Take the median crossing time per star as <span
class="math display">\[t_\mathrm{cross} =
\sqrt{\frac{r_{1/2}^3}{GM}},\]</span> assuming an average stellar mass
of 0.8 <span class="math inline">\(M_\odot\)</span> [citation needed].
With this, only a handful of clusters have relaxation times greater than
the 5 Gyr integration time used in our simulations. These include:</p>
<p><em>NGC 2419, NGC 5139, Pal 14, Pal 15, FSR1758, Ter 8,
Sagittarius II.</em></p>
<p>Across the catalog, the average relaxation time is 1.5 Gyr, the
median is 0.8 Gyr, the maximum is 21 Gyr, and the minimum is 0.03
Gyr.</p>
<h3 id="beyond-two-body-relaxation">Beyond Two-Body Relaxation</h3>
<p>By modeling globular clusters with the restricted three-body problem,
we neglect mass loss due to internal dynamics. Ignoring this has a
consequence. The number density, extension, and luminosity of the stream
can be greatly influenced by the internal dynamics. The internal
dynamics involve a rich variety of physical processes that not only
drive their internal evolution but also contribute to stellar escape
through mechanisms other than tides. Many of these processes are
reviewed in <span class="citation"
data-cites="2003gmbp.book.....H">Heggie and Hut (2003)</span> and have
been the subject of decades of study <span class="citation"

and Shapiro 1978; Chernoff and Weinberg 1990; Meylan and Heggie
1997)</span>. Interestingly, many macrophysical behaviors emerge from
microscopic interactions, such as repeated two-body encounters or
three-body interactions. In this section, I focus on how these internal
processes can affect the morphology and properties of the stellar
streams that globular clusters produce.</p>

(2023, 2024)</span> performed a study similar to our Chapter 4. While we
investigated the mass loss of the globular cluster catalog due to tidal
stripping, they examined the cumulative mass loss induced by three-body
interactions within globular cluster cores. An example of this mass
ejection distribution is shown in Fig. <a
href="#fig:grondin_et_al_core_spray" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:grondin_et_al_core_spray">23</a>. Indeed, globular
clusters host many binary systems that can significantly influence
cluster dynamics. As <span class="citation"
data-cites="2024MNRAS.528.5189G">Grondin et al. (2024)</span> describe,
a third star engage with the binary leading to the ejection of one star
with significant kinetic energy. Such velocities can exceed the cluster
escape velocity. Not only the energy be high enough to escape, but it
may be so high has completely erase the effective potential barrier
(Fig. <a href="#fig:CR3BP_forbidden_region" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:CR3BP_forbidden_region">7</a>) and escape in any
direction. The result is a population of stars that escape in a more
isotropic and diffuse manner than those lost through tidal stripping
alone.</p>

<p>These high-velocity escapers are of particular interest in light of
stars in the Gaia catalog that appear to exceed the Galactic escape
speed <span class="citation" data-cites="2021ApJS..252....3L">(Li et al.
2021)</span>. Proposed origins for these stars include supernova kicks
within binary systems, where one component goes supernova and imparts a
substantial recoil to the companion, or dynamical ejections from dense
cluster cores. Some studies even suggest that globular clusters may
contribute to the population of hypervelocity stars.</p>
<p>Not only do we gain a lot of physics when we consider the stars to
have mass, but we gain even more when we consider the stars to have a
distribution of masses. <span class="citation"
data-cites="1955ApJ...121..161S">Salpeter (1955)</span> proposed one of
the first stellar mass functions based on stellar counts. A current
popular model is that of <span class="citation"
data-cites="2001MNRAS.322..231K">Kroupa (2001)</span> who created a
piece-wise mass function to account for the lower end of the
distribution tapering off. By introducing such a mass function to the
globular clusters, a suite of physics is unlocked. One well-known
example is <em>dynamical friction</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="1943ApJ....97..255C 1943ApJ....97..263C 1943ApJ....98...54C">(Chandrasekhar
1943a, 1943b, 1943c)</span>, which describes how massive bodies lose
orbital energy through interactions with less massive ones, causing them
to sink toward the center of the cluster. This process is the basis for
<em>mass segregation</em>, in which massive stars concentrate toward the
center. The underlying statistical tendency is toward energy
equipartition, where the average kinetic energy per particle is constant
across the system. Since <span class="math inline">\(E \propto m \langle
v^2 \rangle\)</span>, this implies <span class="math inline">\(\langle
v^2 \rangle \propto 1/m\)</span>. However, in real clusters, relaxation
times can be long, and equipartition may remain incomplete over the
cluster lifetime <span class="citation"
data-cites="2016MNRAS.458.3644B 2025A&amp;A...698A.209Z">(Bianchini et
al. 2016; Ziliotto et al. 2025)</span>. Moreover, since tides
preferentially remove the stars on the most weakly bound (i.e.,
high-energy) orbits, they tend to strip low-mass stars first.</p>
<p>Next, not only can we consider the the implications of modeling the
stars to have mass, but also what we cain when considering them to be
actual stars, i.e., luminous, gaseous bodies in hydrostatic equilibrium.
By relaxing this constraint, an even more complex picture emerges. Stars
vary in mass, age, and composition, which affect their luminosity and
detectability. <span class="citation"
data-cites="2008A&amp;A...490..151K">Kruijssen and Lamers (2008)</span>
demonstrated that low-mass stars and stellar remnants like white dwarfs
preferentially escape from the clusters, which effects the global
luminosity profile of a cluster. <span class="citation"
data-cites="2018MNRAS.474.2479B">Balbinot and Gieles (2018)</span> took
this a step further explored how internal cluster dynamics shape the
escape of stars with different luminosities. They arrived at a seemingly
paradoxical result: more massive clusters can produce <em>less
detectable</em> stellar streams. The reason is twofold: more massive
clusters harbor more low-mass stars, which are intrinsically dimmer, and
these same stars are preferentially stripped due to mass segregation.
The resulting streams, though potentially more massive, are fainter and
harder to detect (see Fig. <a href="#fig:balbinot-2018"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:balbinot-2018">24</a>).</p>

<p>Not only do the stars have luminosities, and that their luminosities
change as they evolve, but stellar evolution can also contribute to the
dynamics of the system. <span class="citation"
data-cites="2018MNRAS.474.2479B">Balbinot and Gieles (2018)</span>
incorporated stellar evolution in their simulations, capturing its
effects on cluster evolution. The most significant contribution occurs
during the first <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span>1 Gyr, when
massive stars end their lives as supernovae. These events eject mass
from the cluster, shallowing its potential well. <span class="citation"
data-cites="2010MNRAS.409..305L">Lamers, Baumgardt, and Gieles
(2010)</span> showed that the mass loss can be broken down in two three
phaes, the first mass loss phase is early in the cluster life and is
dominated by stellar evolution. which means the super-novae of the
exploding stars can just ejected the stellar material outside of the
cluster. if it was in a binary system then it can also eject a low-mass
star. The authors note that this does strongly depend on the initial
metallicity of the cluster and the initial mass function. <a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> The
early stages of globular cluster evolution is particularly for our
purposes, since our simulations begin 5 Gyr ago, and all clusters
considered are much older.</p>
<p>Indeed, future extention of our models to improve genreality of our
results can include some internal evolution of the globular cluster
dynamics, potential using prescriptive methods since we want to still
have cheap computations so that we can explore a large set of the
parameter space. Perhaps we could create a partilce spray method like
that of the Fardel that is employed in the works of Bonaca or Bovy.
However, we would have to ensure that the mass loss is linked to the
tidal field. We also want to make sure that the some of the internal
considerations can be well modeled like the binary fraction, metalicity,
age, and initial mass function. With this, we can begin to engage with
detectability of the streams to make better comparisons with our
simulated catalog with the observations …</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Galaxies span millions of light-years, so how can
Newton’s assumption of instantaneous gravity be valid, given that
gravitational waves travel at the speed of light? As shown by <span
class="citation" data-cites="2000PhLA..267...81C">Carlip (2000)</span>,
this is well understood in General Relativity: the gravitational field
encodes not only the position but also the motion of massive bodies.
This ensures that the resulting spacetime curvature produces a force
equivalent to attraction toward the body’s instantaneous position,
rather than where it was when the gravitational influence was emitted.<a
href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>The term “integral of motion” is often used
interchangeably with “constant of motion”, but strictly speaking, the
latter is preferable since it refers to a quantity that remains constant
throughout the orbital evolution, not to an integral in the mathematical
sense of the word (area under a curve).<a href="#fnref2"
class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>The two-body relaxation experiment is purely
illustrative. Despite multiple attempts, I was unable to make the
numerical results consistent with the theoretical prediction. Not only
is the relaxation process significantly slower than expected, but the
discrepancy also worsens with increasing particle number. I rewrote the
script several times but was unable to identify the issue. Nonetheless,
the main takeaway remains valid: gravitational two-body encounters
induce a random walk in velocity space.<a href="#fnref3"
class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>I once wondered whether the kinetic energy injected into
surrounding stars by a supernova’s ejecta might be dynamically
important. A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows it is negligible and
mass of the exploded stars wisps out of the cluster.<a href="#fnref4"
