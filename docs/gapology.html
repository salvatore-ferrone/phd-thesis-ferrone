<p>The most accurate model of the Palomar 5 stream would involve full
modeling of the internal dynamics of the cluster, which would mean
computing <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>-body interactions with
a <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}(N^2)\)</span> computation
time, stellar evolution, supernovae, an initial mass distribution,
treatment of binary star systems, etc. <span class="citation"
data-cites="2021NatAs...5..957G 2016MNRAS.458.1450W">(for such an
example, see Gieles et al. 2021; Wang et al. 2016)</span>. Instead, we
opt for solving the restricted-three-body problem, also known as the
particle-test method, as we did for <span class="citation"
data-cites="2023A&amp;A...673A..44F">Ferrone et al. (2023)</span>, which
we describe here for completeness. As demonstrated by <span
class="citation"
data-cites="2012A&amp;A...546L...7M">Mastrobuono-Battisti et al.
(2012)</span>, although the restricted three-body problem neglects the
internal evolution of the cluster, it still reproduces very similar
stream properties since the model captures key extracluster physics,
such as disk shocking and epicyclic stripping.<br />
Below, we first present the approach used to include the Galactic
globular cluster system in our modeling (Sect. <a href="#numerical_meth"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="numerical_meth">2.1</a>),
highlighting the similarities and differences with respect to what we
did in <span class="citation"
data-cites="2023A&amp;A...673A..44F">Ferrone et al. (2023)</span>; we
then summarize the method used to model the mass loss from the cluster
(Sect. <a href="#sec:mass_loss" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:mass_loss">2.2</a>) and finally discuss the quality
of the numerical integration (Sect. <a href="#num_quality"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="num_quality">2.3</a>).</p>
<h2 id="numerical_meth">Numerical methodology</h2>
<p>We begin by extracting positions in the sky, proper motions,
line-of-sight velocities, and distances, as well as masses and half-mass
radii, of 165 globular clusters from the Galactic globular cluster
catalog by <span class="citation"
data-cites="2021MNRAS.505.5957B">(Baumgardt and Vasiliev 2021)</span>.<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> We then convert the initial
conditions from sky coordinates into a Galactocentric reference frame,
by adopting a velocity for the local standard of rest of <span
class="math inline">\(v_{\text{LSR}} = 240\)</span> km s<span
class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> and a peculiar velocity of the Sun
equal to <span class="math inline">\((U_\odot, V_\odot, W_\odot)=(11.1,
12.24, 7.25)\)</span> km s<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span>, as
reported by <span class="citation"
data-cites="2012MNRAS.427..274S">Schönrich (2012)</span>. We set the
Sun’s position to <span class="math inline">\((x_\odot,y_\odot,z_\odot)
= (-8.34,0,0.027)\)</span> kpc. We took the vertical position above the
disk from <span class="citation" data-cites="2001ApJ...553..184C">Chen
et al. (2001)</span> and the distance of the Sun to the Galactic center
from <span class="citation" data-cites="2014ApJ...783..130R">Reid et al.
(2014)</span>. These transformations were performed using
<code>astropy</code> <span class="citation"
data-cites="2013A&amp;A...558A..33A">(Astropy Collaboration et al.
2013)</span>.</p>
<p>For the Galactic potential, we employed the second model from <span
class="citation" data-cites="2017A&amp;A...598A..66P">Pouliasis, Di
Matteo, and Haywood (2017)</span>, a superposition of a thin disk, thick
disk, and dark matter halo, with masses and scale lengths provided in
Table 1 of <span class="citation"
data-cites="2023A&amp;A...673A..44F">Ferrone et al. (2023)</span>. This
model is time-independent throughout our simulations. This model
satisfies a series of observational constraints such as local solar,
stellar density, the Galactic rotation curve, similarly to other
Galactic models such as <code>MWpotential2014</code> from <span
class="citation" data-cites="2015ApJS..216...29B">Bovy (2015)</span> and
<code>McMillian2017</code> from <span class="citation"
data-cites="2017MNRAS.465...76M">McMillan (2017)</span>. However, we use
only one Galactic potential to balance data volume and computation time,
which should suffice. <span class="citation"
data-cites="2021MNRAS.505.5978V">Vasiliev and Baumgardt (2021)</span>
found that only a few outer globular clusters are strongly affected by
different potential models. Generally, kinematic uncertainties are the
dominant factor in differences between orbital solutions per cluster.
Similarly, <span class="citation"
data-cites="2024MNRAS.528.5189G">Grondin et al. (2024)</span> generated
a globular cluster mass-loss catalog using seven different potential
models and found that their debris distributions were rather
model-independent, similar to those of <span class="citation"
data-cites="2023A&amp;A...673A..44F">Ferrone et al. (2023)</span>. While
the clusters’ exact positions in time may depend on the model, we assert
that interaction rates and stream formation are largely independent of
the choice of the Galactic potential model.</p>
<p>Lastly, we select an integration time of 5 Gyr as a compromise
between maximizing interaction statistics and modeling the Galaxy as a
time-independent, constant mass distribution. <span class="citation"
data-cites="2023A&amp;A...673A.152I">Ishchenko et al. (2023)</span>
analyzed the orbits of the Galactic cluster population using the same
initial conditions as in this work within five live Milky Way-like
potentials from IllustrisTNG <span class="citation"
data-cites="2018MNRAS.473.4077P">(Pillepich et al. 2018)</span>. They
found that in all sampled potentials, orbital changes remain minimal
over 5 Gyr, becoming significant only at earlier look-back times when
the host galaxy had significantly less mass or was undergoing a merger
event.</p>
<h3 id="full-simulations"> <code>Full</code> simulations</h3>
<p>There is a primary methodological departure from <span
class="citation" data-cites="2023A&amp;A...673A..44F">Ferrone et al.
(2023)</span>. In that work, globular clusters evolved under the
gravitational effect of the Galaxy alone. In contrast, now we also
consider the effect of all other Galactic globular clusters by taking
into account the direct <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>-body
interactions between them. First, all clusters are represented by
Plummer spheres, each with its own mass and half-mass radius as reported
in the Baumgardt catalog <span class="citation"
data-cites="2021MNRAS.505.5957B">(Baumgardt and Vasiliev 2021)</span>.
For the remainder of this paper, the <code>full</code> simulations
consider the gravitational forces from the globular cluster
interactions.<br />
For these simulations, we proceeded in two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>First, starting from the Galactocentric positions and velocities
of all 165 Galactic globular clusters, we integrate their orbits back in
time for 5 Gyr under the influence of the Galaxy itself and their mutual
influence. In the backward integration, the system of equations of
motion for the globular clusters is thus: <span
class="math display">\[\ddot{\vec{r}}_i = -\nabla \Phi +
\left.\sum_{j\neq i}^{N_{GC}} \frac{Gm_j}{\left(|\vec{r}_j -
\vec{r}_i|^2 + b_j^2\right)^{3/2}}\right. \left(\vec{r}_j -
\vec{r}_i\right),\]</span><span id="eq:GCNBody"
data-label="eq:GCNBody"></span> where <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{r}\)</span> indicates the Galactocentric
position vector, the index <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>
indicates the globular cluster of interest; the index <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span> indicates the other globular clusters
that are summed over. <span class="math inline">\(N_{GC}\)</span> is the
total number of globular clusters, which in this study is 165, <span
class="math inline">\(m_j\)</span> is the mass of the j-th cluster in
the sample, <span class="math inline">\(b_j\)</span> is its Plummer
scale radius, and <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r_j}\)</span> is its
Galactocentric position. <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span>
represents the same Galactic smooth potential that we discussed
previously <span class="citation"
data-cites="2017A&amp;A...598A..66P">(Pouliasis, Di Matteo, and Haywood
2017, Model II, in the present case)</span>. Note that the masses and
sizes of the globular clusters are kept constant in these simulations
and are not allowed to vary with time, which means that we do not
consider their internal evolution. In sec. <a href="#sec:discussion"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:discussion">4</a>, we
discuss the implications of the modeling limitations.</p></li>
<li><p>Once we found the positions and velocities of the entire globular
cluster, we sampled Palomar 5 with 100,000 particles from a Plummer
distribution, taking the mass and half-mass radius from the Baumgardt
catalog: <span
class="math inline">\(1.3\times10^{4}~\mathrm{M}_\odot\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(27.6~\mathrm{pc}\)</span>. We then
integrated the evolution of these particles forward in time to the
present day, taking into account that each particle feels the
gravitational potential of the Galaxy, its host cluster, and that of all
the other clusters in the Galaxy. Note that we do not account for
self-gravity among particles. The particles experience the gravitational
field yet do not contribute to it, a common assumption in galactic
dynamics, as the mass of an individual star is negligible compared to
the mass of the larger dynamical system. The equation of motion of a
generic particle among the 100,000 that populate Palomar 5 is thus:
<span class="math display">\[\ddot{\vec{r}}_p = -\nabla \Phi +
\left.\sum_{j}^{N_{GC}} \frac{Gm_j}{\left(|\vec{r}_j(t) - \vec{r}_p|^2 +
b_j^2\right)^{3/2}}\right. \left(\vec{r}_j(t)-
\vec{r}_p\right),\]</span> <span id="eq:equation_of_motion_particle"
data-label="eq:equation_of_motion_particle"></span> where the index
<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> represents one of the 100,000
particles of interest, <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r_p}\)</span>
being its position, and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> indexes
over the globular clusters as in Eq. <a href="#eq:GCNBody"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:GCNBody">[eq:GCNBody]</a>.
We note that in Eq. <a href="#eq:equation_of_motion_particle"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="eq:equation_of_motion_particle">[eq:equation_of_motion_particle]</a>,
the positions of the globular clusters are time-dependent since they are
being loaded during this step and not computed, unlike Eq. <a
href="#eq:GCNBody" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="eq:GCNBody">[eq:GCNBody]</a>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The procedure described so far has been repeated 50 times, generating
a new set of initial conditions each time, given the uncertainties on
proper motions, line-of-sight velocities, distances to the Sun, and
masses of all clusters, as reported in the Baumgardt catalog. We handle
these uncertainties through a Monte-Carlo approach by sampling them with
a Gaussian distribution and considering the covariance term between the
proper motions. We use the most probable values for the initial
conditions in the first simulation. We sample the uncertainties for all
globular clusters. Additionally, for each resampling of Palomar 5’s
mass, we also resample the distribution of the 100,000 star
particles.</p>
<p>During the integration, we save intermediate snapshots to facilitate
the analysis of stellar streams and the effects of cluster impacts.
Specifically, for each realization of the Palomar 5 stream, we saved
<span class="math inline">\(5000\)</span> in snapshots, equivalent to a
temporal resolution of 1 million years. We provide the parameters that
specify our data volume in Table <a href="#tab:data_volume"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab:data_volume">1</a>. Using
single precision floating point numbers, the size of our simulations is

<h3 id="reference-simulations"> <code>Reference</code> simulations</h3>
<p>To quantify the impact of globular cluster passages on the density of
the Palomar 5 stream, we performed a second set of simulations, which we
refer to as the <code>reference</code> simulations in this paper. These
<code>reference</code> simulations use the same 50 sets of initial
conditions as the <code>full</code> simulations, the same Galactic
potential, but exclude mutual interactions between globular clusters.
The approach adopted for this second set of simulations is thus
equivalent to that adopted already in <span class="citation"
data-cites="2023A&amp;A...673A..44F">Ferrone et al. (2023)</span>. In
Eq. <a href="#eq:GCNBody" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="eq:GCNBody">[eq:GCNBody]</a>, only the gradient of the
Galactic potential is considered. In Eq. <a
href="#eq:equation_of_motion_particle" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="eq:equation_of_motion_particle">[eq:equation_of_motion_particle]</a>,
of the second term on the right side of the equation, only the influence
of Palomar 5’s Plummer sphere on Palomar 5’s particles is considered. In
other words, the sum iterates over only one globular cluster, the host.
We omit all interactions with the other clusters.</p>
<h2 id="sec:mass_loss">Mass loss</h2>
<p>Each of the 100,000 particles that initially populate the cluster
undergoes experiences the forces from Pal 5 and the Galactic potential.
The mass and radius of Pal 5 are held constant over time. At each time
step, a certain number of particles will therefore acquire sufficient
energy to no longer be gravitationally bound to the cluster itself and
thus go on to populate the streams, whose mass and spatial extent grow
over time. It is important to note that in the approach used:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The masses and sizes of the clusters (and therefore the
parameters of the Plummer potentials) do not change over time, which is
an oversimplification, because in a self-consistent approach, these
parameters would vary.</p></li>
<li><p>We use the same initial conditions for Pal 5 progenitor as it has
today, and this is also a simplification, since Pal 5 - 5 Gyr years ago
- must have contained at least part of the mass estimated today in its
tails<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The assumption in point 2 is a direct consequence of the approach
described in point 1. Starting from a cluster with a mass and size
similar to the current ones can lead to streams with lower velocity
dispersions than those we would obtain if we had used a self-consistent
approach. In a future article, we will report on the study of gap
survival times depending on the masses and sizes of progenitor clusters
(Ferrone et al, in prep). We note, however, that simplifications of this
kind are not uncommon in literature. <span class="citation"
data-cites="2017NatAs...1..633P">Pearson, Price-Whelan, and Johnston
(2017)</span> discussed the formation of gaps in the Pal 5 tails and
assumed a time-independent mass of <span class="math inline">\(50,000
~\mathrm{M}_\odot\)</span> for Pal 5, over the last 4 Gyr; <span
class="citation" data-cites="2017MNRAS.470...60E">Erkal, Koposov, and
Belokurov (2017)</span> adopted a N-body approach to simulate Pal 5

the Pal 5 stream as emerging from a stellar system with a velocity
dispersion of 0.5 km/s (similar to that of particles escaping from our
cluster, as we have verified).</p>
<p>The characteristics of the streams modeled in this paper may be
considered more representative of those of clusters that are now
completely dispersed, i.e., it is conceivable that completely dispersed
globular clusters that left behind a population of ‘orphan’ streams
passed through characteristics similar to those of Pal 5 today (small
masses and extended radii). In this sense, the initial conditions chosen
(in terms of internal parameters) may be more representative of those of
streams for which the progenitor is now dissolved <span class="citation"

<p>We used a leapfrog integrator because of its ability to preserve

step. For instance, this method is preferable to a Runge-Kutta scheme,
which can introduce non-physical and significant numerical errors in
systems that require long-term stability and energy conservation. One
drawback of the leapfrog integrator is that it requires a uniform time
step throughout the entire computation, resulting in unnecessary
computations for a particle after it has escaped from the host cluster.
However, energy conservation and phase-space volume preservation are
paramount when modeling stellar streams. The time step was therefore set
to be small enough to conserve energy for the most interior particles
within the cluster—ensuring that a higher mass loss did not arise from
numerical error. We found that a time-step of 10,000 years was adequate
to maintain energy conservation, with a median variation of <span
class="math inline">\(10^{-12} \frac{\Delta E}{E_0}\)</span>, where
<span class="math inline">\(E_0\)</span> is a particle’s initial energy,
and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta E\)</span> is the difference
between its final and initial energy.</p>
<p>We also checked the reverse integrability of the globular cluster
system for the <code>reference</code> simulations. By reverse
integrability, we mean the integrator’s capability to track the cluster
backward in time and then re-integrate it forward along the same
trajectory. Integrating point masses in a static axis-symmetric
potential conserves <span class="math inline">\(L_z\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, which create regular periodic and
non-chaotic orbits. Therefore, any drift would arise from purely
numerical error. We selected a timestamp for which the drift in the
final position after forward integration, compared to the initial
position from the backward integration, was consistently at least two
orders of magnitude smaller than the Plummer scale radius used for
Palomar 5. This high precision ensures that no fictitious numerical
forces influence the system, preventing any artificial mass loss or
retention of star particles.</p>

<p>The presence of the other globular clusters affects the properties of
the Palomar 5 stream. Fig. <a href="#fig:stream_on_sky"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:stream_on_sky">[fig:stream_on_sky]</a> presents an
obvious example of this effect, which we selected for its prominent
gaps. Two of these gaps are visible in Galactic coordinates and become
even more apparent when marginalizing over latitude to reconstruct the
1D density profile of the stream as a function of longitude.</p>
<p>Regarding the shape of the density distribution, the central peak
corresponds to the still-intact globular cluster whose stars have not
yet escaped. The stream’s density peaks are of the same order as the
cluster itself, which is inconsistent with reality; the cluster’s peak
density should be higher than that of the stream. Of course, this
discrepancy is a result of our modeling choices. Since we use the
present-day mass and radius for Palomar 5 for the whole simulation
duration, the system is less dense than it should have been. In turn,
our simulations have a strong initial mass loss, which adds to the
amplitudes of the profile density peaks of Fig. <a
href="#fig:stream_on_sky" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:stream_on_sky">[fig:stream_on_sky]</a>. This
inaccuracy is acceptable for the scope of this work. First, Palomar 5’s
tails indeed have more mass than the cluster itself. <span
class="citation" data-cites="2017ApJ...842..120I">R. A. Ibata et al.
(2017)</span> reports that there could be three times as much mass in
Palomar 5’s tails as the cluster itself. Secondly, the exact form of the
density distribution is less important than having a population of
particles present that can probe a cluster flyby event.</p>
<p>To compare the <code>reference</code> and <code>full</code>
simulations more quantitatively, we work in the tail coordinate system,
in which the stream’s central axis aligns with the cluster’s orbit. We
based this coordinate system on the work of <span class="citation"
data-cites="2004AJ....127.2753D">Dehnen et al. (2004)</span> and present
it in Fig. <a href="#fig:TailCoordinates" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:TailCoordinates">4</a>. Briefly, in this system, the
<span class="math inline">\(x_{\mathrm{tail}}\)</span> coordinate
represents the position of a particle along the orbit relative to the
globular cluster. Positive values of <span
class="math inline">\(x_{\mathrm{tail}}\)</span> are ahead of the
cluster, while negative <span
class="math inline">\(x_{\mathrm{tail}}\)</span> is behind the cluster.
The <span class="math inline">\(y_{\mathrm{tail}}\)</span> coordinate
measures the particle’s distance within the orbital plane, where
positive values indicate that the particle is farther from the Galactic
center and negative values indicate that it is closer. Fig. <a
href="#fig:decomposition" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:decomposition">[fig:decomposition]</a> shows a
comparison between one of the 50 realizations of the Palomar 5 stream,
taking into account the gravitational interactions with all other
globular clusters in the Galaxy (top panel) and omitting them (bottom
panel). This comparison clearly shows the presence of two wide (<span
class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span>100 pc and <span
class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span>1 kpc) gaps in the leading tail and
of a more subtle underdensity at <span
class="math inline">\(x_{\mathrm{tail}}\sim 5\)</span> kpc (we refer the
reader to Appendix <a href="#sec:gap_detection"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:gap_detection">6.1</a> for
a detailed description of the underdensities and gaps detection
method).</p>
<p>To determine which globular clusters were responsible for creating
these gaps and when close passages occurred, we estimated the
gravitational acceleration along the orbit of Palomar 5. We represented
it in the (<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>) space. <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is the simulation time, and <span
class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> indicates how long it will take for
Palomar 5 to reach a given point in its orbit or how long ago it passed.
The use of <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> is advantageous
because the growth of the stream is approximately linear in <span
class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, streams in physical space are modulated by their
orbital eccentricity with periodic expansion and contraction depending
on the orbital phase <span class="citation"
data-cites="2016MNRAS.457.3817S">(see the top panel of Fig. 5. Sanders,
Bovy, and Erkal 2016, for an example)</span>. Adopting this time-space
and reporting the gravitational acceleration along the Palomar 5 orbit
in this space, identifying the globular clusters that produced the
perturbation and the time at which it occurred becomes straightforward.
We refer the reader to Appendix <a href="#sec:Perturber_Identification"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:Perturber_Identification">6.2</a> for a detailed
description of the procedure. In this way, we can identify that the
clusters responsible for creating gaps in the simulation of the
Palomar 5 stream, as reported in Fig. <a href="#fig:decomposition"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:decomposition">[fig:decomposition]</a>, are
NGC 2808, NGC 7078, and NGC 104. Their close passages occurred 200 Myr,
-1.9, and -2.1 Gyr ago, respectively.</p>
<p>To further investigate whether the three clusters above are
responsible for producing the gaps observed in this simulation, we
conducted additional experiments by including only the perturbation of
each cluster at a time, while neglecting the gravitational perturbations
of all the other clusters in the Galaxy.</p>
<p>To verify that the three suspected clusters are responsible for
producing the gaps, we conducted experiments by including one perturbed
at a time and excluding all others. We present these results in the
middle panels of Fig. <a href="#fig:decomposition"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:decomposition">[fig:decomposition]</a> and clearly
show that NGC 2808, NGC 7078, and NGC 104 are the clusters responsible
for creating the underdense regions observed in the leading tails of
Palomar 5. It is worth noting that the times at which the passages of
these clusters occurred, according to our analysis, are in agreement
with the observed width of the corresponding gaps: the encounter with
NGC 2808 being very recent (only 200 Myr ago), its induced gap is still
very thin, because it takes time for a perturbation to grow into an
extended gap, as it is the case for those induced by the passages of
NGC 7078 and NGC 104, which occurred in earlier times. It is also
interesting to emphasize that gaps as thin as those generated by the
passage of NGC 2808, 200 Myr ago, can be detected by working in the tail
coordinate system and by making a comparative analysis
(<code>full</code> versus <code>reference</code> simulations): they are
so thin that they cannot be directly identified in Galactic coordinates
(see Fig. <a href="#fig:stream_on_sky" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:stream_on_sky">[fig:stream_on_sky]</a>).<br />
The analysis presented in Fig. <a href="#fig:decomposition"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:decomposition">[fig:decomposition]</a> has been
repeated for the whole set of simulations, and <a
href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15528089">online appendix</a>
reports all of them for completeness. For all the streams,
morphologically speaking, the only changes appear to be the existence of
gaps or their absence. We do not observe a thickening of the streams due
to an increased velocity dispersion.</p>
<p>From this analysis, we can derive a statistical view of (1) the
number of gaps generated on the Palomar 5 stream by the system of
Galactic globular clusters, (2) the clusters that generated these gaps,
and the time history of these perturbations. From this, we can then
quantify (3) the properties of the perturbers (their masses, sizes, and
orbital parameters) as well as (4) the impact geometry of the
encounters, which allows us to understand which encounters are more
favorable for generating gaps in the Palomar 5 stream. In the following,
we will present the results of this analysis, addressing points (1) and
(2).</p>
<h2 id="sect:history">The history and statistics of gap creations in the
Palomar 5 stream</h2>
<p>By applying the methodology described above to the whole set of
simulations, we can reconstruct the history of close passages of
Galactic globular clusters to Palomar 5’s stream in the last 5 Gyr,
which – we remind the reader – is the time interval investigated in our
simulations. Fig. <a href="#fig:histogram_impact_time"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:histogram_impact_time">[fig:histogram_impact_time]</a>
and Table <a href="#tab:gaps_per_perturber" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="tab:gaps_per_perturber">2</a> present results of this
analysis. NGC 2808 impacted Palomar 5’s stream about 200 Myr ago in 44
out of 50 simulations, creating a small gap at a similar position to the
one reported in Fig. <a href="#fig:decomposition"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:decomposition">[fig:decomposition]</a> in each case.
Since this interaction occurred less than one orbital period ago,
despite the uncertainties, the orbital solutions remain similar and thus
produce consistent results across all simulations. However, as we
continue to turn back time further, the uncertainties in the initial
conditions allow the various orbital solutions to diverge from one
another. Thus, in one configuration, a cluster can impact the stream at
a given time, and yet at the same moment, in a different set of initial
conditions, it could be on the other side of the Galaxy. We will discuss
the necessary conditions for creating a gap in Appendix <a

<p>We need a more sophisticated statistic to compare our results to
other simulations, so we turn to the gap creation rate developed by
<span class="citation" data-cites="2012ApJ...748...20C">Carlberg
(2012)</span>. The gap creation rate is the number of gaps that appear
per unit time and is normalized by the stream’s length. For our
simulations, this rate is given by: <span
class="math display">\[\label{eq:gap_creation_rate}
\mathcal{R}_{\mathrm{Pal 5}} =  \frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^T l^{-1}(t) \sum_i
\delta(t-t_i) dt,\]</span>where <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>
is the total integration time, <span class="math inline">\(l(t)\)</span>
is the length of the stream, and <span class="math inline">\(\sum_i
\delta(t-t_i)\)</span> sums over the gap occurrences, with <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span> indexing over the number of gaps in a
given simulation. Here, <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span>
represents the Dirac delta function. This expression can be simplified
to:<span class="math display">\[\mathcal{R}_{\mathrm{Pal 5}}
=  \frac{1}{T} \sum_i \frac{1}{l (t_i)}.\]</span></p>
<p>This computation allowed us to analyze the distribution of gap
creation rates across all simulations. Notice that since the gap
creation rate adds in parallel, naturally, gaps that occur at earlier
times when the stream was shorter are weighted higher than those that
occur when the stream is longer. Fig. <a href="#fig:gapcreationrate"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:gapcreationrate">1</a>
presents these results which are is roughly consistent with a simple
estimate of the average gap creation rate: with 73 gaps over 5 Gyr of
integration time for a stream about 20 kpc in length, the naive estimate
is approximately 0.015 km s<span
class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> kpc<span
class="math inline">\(^{-2}\)</span> (which is roughly equivalent to
<span class="math inline">\(0.015~\rm{Gyr^{-1}kpc^{-1}}\)</span>). This
naive estimate is about double the weighted mean gap creation rate of
0.009 km s<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> kpc<span
class="math inline">\(^{-2}\)</span> and is higher because it does not
account for the growth of the stream over time, unlike Eq. <a

data-reference="eq:gap_creation_rate">[eq:gap_creation_rate]</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>Lastly, we note that of the 73 observed gaps, only eight are in the
trailing tail, and the rest are in the leading tail, which is a
surprising result. A priori, since the star particles escape at similar
rates from the L<span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> and L<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> Lagrange points, each tail is of
similar length and density. The main difference between the two tails is
that the leading tail is closer to the Galactic center than the trailing
tail by about 400 pc. Since the lengths are equal, and the offset
between the tails is slight compared to the Galactocentric distance of
about 10 kpc, we expected the gaps in each tail to be more or less the
same. We can compute the probability of observing the unequal
occurrences through the binomial distribution. First, since the 44 gaps
linked to NGC 2808 are the result of the same flyby, they are not
independent events. We remove them from this consideration, which leaves
21 gaps in the leading tail and 8 in the trailing. The probability of
observing up to 8 successes in 29 trials, given a 50% chance of success,
is 1.2%–unlikely, but possible. Additionally, other perturbers impact at
consistent times, which may violate the assumption of independent
events, as seen with NGC 2808.</p>
<h2 id="sect:geometry">Impact geometry and parameters of the
perturbers</h2>
<div class="figure*">
<p><img src="images/impact_geometry_statistics.png" alt="image" /></p>
</div>
<p>With the perturbers identified, we perform statistical analysis to
understand the conditions necessary for a globular cluster to induce a
gap in the Palomar 5 stream. We turn to impact theory, which in its
simplest form is presented in works such as <span class="citation"
data-cites="2008gady.book.....B">Binney and Tremaine (2008)</span>.
Consider two particles: one stationary and the other moving past it. The
impact parameter is the distance between the two particles at the point
of their closest approach. The impulse approximation is employed, which
assumes that the velocity of the perturber remains unchanged during the
interaction. This assumption simplifies the computation.</p>
<p>To understand how the impacted particle is perturbed, one needs to
compute its change in momentum, which is determined by integrating the
force acting on the particle throughout the interaction. A useful
approximation for this change in momentum, per unit mass, is the force
at the closest approach multiplied by an estimate of the interaction
time: <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:change_in_momentum} \Delta
p \approx \text{Force} \times \text{interaction time} = \frac{GM}{b^2}
\times 2\frac{b}{\delta v} = 2\frac{GM}{b \delta v},\]</span>where <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is the mass of the perturber, <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is the impact parameter, <span
class="math inline">\(\delta v\)</span> is the relative velocity of the
perturber with respect to the particle, and <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is the gravitational constant.</p>
<p>This equation asserts that a more massive perturber, passing closer
to the particle and moving more slowly, will have a greater impact. It
is important to note that the momentum change is inversely proportional
to the velocity of the perturber. Note that this contrasts with the
intuition from elastic collisions, such as those between billiard balls,
where higher velocities result in greater impacts.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="2015MNRAS.450.1136E">Erkal and
Belokurov (2015)</span> extended this impact theory from one point mass
impacting another to studying how an extended body impacts a stream by
quantifying the change in momentum of a given particle as a function of
its distance from the point of greatest impact along the stream. <span
class="citation" data-cites="2015MNRAS.450.1136E">Erkal and Belokurov
(2015)</span> models their perturber as a Plummer sphere, like in our
simulations. Since a stream is not a point but has length and an
orientation in space, one needs to consider the parallel and
perpendicular components of the velocity to describe the impact fully.
Consequently, five parameters determine the change in velocity of a
given stream particle: <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(r_p\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(W_\parallel\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(W_\perp\)</span>, which are the mass of the
perturber, size of the perturber, impact parameter, parallel and
perpendicular components of the relative velocity. As detailed in
Appendix <a href="#sec:reconstruction" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:reconstruction">6.3</a>, we calculated these
parameters for all our <code>full</code> simulations by selecting – for
each of them – the strongest five flybys of a perturber with the
Palomar 5 stream. Thus, we compute 250 impacts and flag those that give
way to gaps.</p>
<p>Visual inspection of the five key impact parameters (<span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(r_p\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(W_\parallel\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(W_\perp\)</span>) did not reveal a clear
distinction between flybys that create gaps and those that do not.
Therefore, we only present the quantities from Eq. <a
href="#eq:change_in_momentum" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="eq:change_in_momentum">[eq:change_in_momentum]</a> in
Fig. <a href="#fig:impact_geometry_statistics" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:impact_geometry_statistics">[fig:impact_geometry_statistics]</a>.</p>
<p>Note that this figure displays the total relative velocity rather
than separating the parallel and perpendicular components, as no
specific trends were observed when plotting the two velocity components
separately. We also excluded the characteristic cluster radius, which
showed little correlation with the results, likely due to the narrow
range of globular cluster radii (see Fig. <a href="#fig:mass_size_plane"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:mass_size_plane">[fig:mass_size_plane]</a>). This
factor might be more significant for dark matter subhalos, where size
variation is greater.</p>
<p>While Fig. <a href="#fig:impact_geometry_statistics"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:impact_geometry_statistics">[fig:impact_geometry_statistics]</a>
demonstrates that mass, relative velocity, or impact parameter alone
cannot predict gap formation, one interesting result emerges: impact
parameters greater than 300 pc do not create gaps. The stream widths are
roughly 200 pc, as seen in the <a
href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15528089">online appendix</a>. This
finding is even more evident when examining the <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>-<span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>
plane. A series of perturbers at roughly <span
class="math inline">\(\sim8 \times 10^5 M_\odot\)</span> highlights
NGC 2808’s flybys, where all encounters with impact parameters under
200 pc result in gaps, while those beyond this distance do not. In other
words, even the most massive globular clusters with masses greater than
about <span class="math inline">\(10^6 M_\odot\)</span> cannot cause
gaps if their impact parameters are greater than roughly <span
class="math inline">\(300\)</span> pc. Interestingly, even fast
encounters (<span class="math inline">\(\delta v &gt; 300\)</span> km/s)
can produce gaps for impact parameter values below this threshold.
Perhaps this is not surprising, since the range of possible relative
velocities is much less than that of mass and impact parameters, which
vary by two and three orders of magnitude, respectively. In contrast,
the relative velocities only vary by about a factor of three.</p>

than encounters that do not form gaps (but with some overlap in the
low-velocity tail). Interestingly, changes in momentum, which lead to
gap creations, extend over a large range in velocities. There is a
factor of about 100 between the smallest and largest changes with
NGC 2808 (orange color in the histogram) imparting changes in the
velocity of stream particles, which redistribute over the whole range of
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta p\)</span>.</p>
<p>In addition to characterizing the parameters governing cluster
encounters with the stream, since we know which clusters have produced
gaps on the tail of Palomar 5, we can also verify their orbital and
structural properties. Fig <a href="#fig:mass_size_plane"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:mass_size_plane">[fig:mass_size_plane]</a> shows
just this, where we first show the clusters’ mass and size (i.e.,
half-mass radius) that cause gaps on the tails of Palomar 5, dividing
them from those that do not. As can be seen, no cluster with mass below
<span class="math inline">\(10^5 M_\odot\)</span> causes gaps on the
Palomar 5 stream, and all perturbers, except FSR 1758, have a half-mass
radius below 10 pc. Even more interesting is their distribution in the
E-L<span class="math inline">\(_z\)</span> plane, which shows that the
clusters that cause gaps are on both direct and retrograde orbits
(negative and positive values of <span
class="math inline">\(L_z\)</span>). However, all of the perturbers
exist in an energy interval between <span
class="math inline">\(-2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(-1
\times10^5~\mathrm{km}^2\mathrm{s}^{-2}\)</span>, which is because only
clusters within Palomar 5’s orbital space can interact with the stream:
clusters with higher orbital energies tend to have larger apocenters
than that of Palomar 5 and thus spend most of their time away from
Palomar 5’s orbital volume.</p>
<p>Finally, it is worth noting the location of impacts with the stream,
specifically whether they occur when Palomar 5 is near its pericenter.
Fig. <a href="#fig:mass_size_plane" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:mass_size_plane">[fig:mass_size_plane]</a>’s bottom
panel shows that encounters can occur at all orbital phases of
Palomar 5, when it is close to the pericenter, but also very far away
from it, at the outskirts of its orbital space. However, when taken all
together, the location of gap-creating impacts shows a strong negative
correlation with the Galactocentric radius <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, with the number <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> of encounters favorable to gap
formation going as <span class="math inline">\(N = -2.5r + 50\)</span>
(with a Pearson coefficient of -0.86). While there are more clusters
near the Galactic center, clusters naturally spend more time near their
apocenters, and the lower relative velocities in these regions should
favor gap creation. However, this result suggests that the cluster
Galactic number density outweighs these factors when determining the
number of gaps. The results are for Palomar 5 only, and a future study
would need to investigate streams along various orbits before
generalizing this conclusion.</p>
<h2 id="comparison-to-observations">Comparison to observations</h2>
<p>We briefly compare our simulated gaps to the literature on Palomar 5.
In the bottom panel of Fig. <a href="#fig:decomposition"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:decomposition">[fig:decomposition]</a>, we compare
the tracks of Palomar 5 that were compiled in <code>galstreams</code> by
<span class="citation" data-cites="2023MNRAS.520.5225M">Mateu
(2023)</span>. The mid-point positions of the streams do not have the
same Galactocentric positions as Palomar 5 from Baumgardt’s catalog, and
this difference creates an offset when projected into tail coordinates.
Moreover, since we sample the distances to Palomar 5, the Galactocentric
position within the Baumgardt catalog varies. To combat this, we
position the mid-point of the <code>Galstream</code> tracks at the
cluster’s center of mass, allowing us to compare the length of the
observed tracks to our simulated streams. We use the three tracks
Pal5-PW19, Pal5-S20, and Pal5-I21 from <span class="citation"
data-cites="2019AJ....158..223P">Price-Whelan et al. (2019)</span>,
<span class="citation" data-cites="2020MNRAS.495.2222S">Sollima
(2020)</span>, and <span class="citation"
data-cites="2021ApJ...914..123I">R. Ibata et al. (2021)</span>,
respectively. For each track, we found the distance from the cluster in
both directions, counting the number of gaps within this range, and we
present this in Fig. <a href="#fig:GapsWithinSight"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:GapsWithinSight">3</a>. In
the maximum limit, many gaps could appear at a rate of about one per
realization. However, only a few gaps occur at the shortest reported
stream length. We note that the gap generated by the recent perturbation
induced on the stream by the passage of NGC 2808 (whose occurrence is
very likely according to our models) sits in a portion of the simulated
tail which is at the edge of the observed one (see bottom panel in
Fig. 2). This element and the fact that this gap is skinny, because it
is very recent, probably make its detection difficult.</p>

most gaps are located on the right-hand side of the stream in any case.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We observe no gaps within 3 kpc of the cluster in our simulation.
There may be a few reasons for the absence of gaps in the portion of the
tails closer to the cluster center. First, as <span class="citation"
data-cites="2016MNRAS.457.3817S">Sanders, Bovy, and Erkal (2016)</span>
demonstrated, the dispersion of action-frequencies in the stream plays a
role. For instance, the frequency corresponding to the azimuthal action,
<span class="math inline">\(J_\phi\)</span>, is <span
class="math inline">\(\dot\theta_\phi = - \frac{\mathcal{\partial
H}}{\partial J_\phi}\)</span> and where <span
class="math inline">\(\theta_\phi\)</span> is the angle describing the
position of the particle phase space between momentum (<span
class="math inline">\(p_\phi\)</span>) and position (<span
class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>) axes—where <span
class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> is the azimuthal angle between the
x-y axes in physical space. Stream regions with well-separated
frequencies are more susceptible to gap formation, while those with a
wide frequency range (near the cluster) tend to erase the history of
impacts. Thus, for a gap to form, the imparted change in frequency must
exceed the range of frequencies in the impacted region. Therefore, the
strong flybys close to the cluster were inconsequential for gap
formation.</p>
<p>Another possible explanation is the different thicknesses of the
simulated tails at different distances from the cluster’s center. At
distances less than 3 kpc from Palomar 5, the tails are skinny, with a
typical thickness of less than 100 pc. To cause gaps in these regions,
the clusters would have to pass close to the stream, with impact
parameters similar to the thickness itself. We note that the thinness of
the tails at these distances is probably a direct consequence of the
initial parameters we chose for the simulation. For Palomar 5, 5 Gyr
years ago, we assumed the same internal parameters (mass and size) as
the cluster today. With such parameters, after 5 Gyr of evolution, our
system has lost most of its mass, and therefore, the part of the tails
closest to the cluster itself, whose density depends mainly on the most
recent mass loss <span class="citation"
data-cites="2012A&amp;A...546L...7M">(see, for example, Fig. A.3 in
Mastrobuono-Battisti et al. 2012)</span>, is necessarily very thin
because the simulated cluster has essentially no more mass to lose. This
last point also has a consequence in the gap creation rate, which we
derived at the end of Sect. <a href="#sect:geometry"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sect:geometry">3.3</a>: with
only 70% of the tail (<span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> 14 kpc
over 20 kpc, excluding the innermost <span class="math inline">\(\pm
3\)</span> kpc from the cluster center) suitable for forming gaps, the
gap creation rates are about 50<span class="math inline">\(\%\)</span>
higher than those estimated in the previous section, where values have
been derived taking into account the full tail extent. This gap creation
rate would still not be high enough to reproduce the number of gaps in
Palomar 5’s tails, as reported by <span class="citation"
data-cites="2012ApJ...760...75C">Carlberg, Grillmair, and Hetherington
(2012)</span>. Their study suggested the presence of five gaps with a
99 % detection confidence, leading to a gap creation rate of
0.17 Gyr<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> kpc<span
class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span>. If correct, this rate would be too
high to be explained by Galactic globular clusters only.</p>
<p>An additional explanation for the absence of gaps in the inner
regions of a stream is given in App. <a href="#sec:gaps_vs_gcmass"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:gaps_vs_gcmass">6.4</a>.
Briefly, the eccentricity of an orbit induces tidal shocking at the
pericenter passages that cause episodes of increased mass loss where the
escaped stars leave with a higher mean velocity and greater velocity
dispersion. In essence, streams from progenitors on eccentric orbits are
made of two components: a continuous flow of stars plus many packets of
stars that burst out from pericenter passages. The gap impact occurs at
a single position, creating a gap in each subpopulation. However, the
gaps have different drift rates across the groups, and they eventually
go out of phase, erasing the impact’s signature. The packets of stars
disperse with time. However, bursts contribute to more escaped stars as
the simulation evolves than the continuous outflow. As a result, at late
stages of the simulation, the region nearest to the globular cluster is
made of distinct yet overlapping populations. After an impact in this
location, the impact site between the groups quickly goes out of
phase.</p>
<h1 id="sec:discussion">Discussion</h1>
<p>The simulations presented in this paper suggest that, in the last
5 Gyr of evolution, Palomar 5’s stream could have experienced multiple
close encounters with other Galactic globular clusters, some of which
can create gaps – even a few kiloparsecs wide – in its tails. Currently,
the literature debates whether or not a gap exists in the observed
portion of Palomar 5 tails. <span class="citation"
data-cites="2016ApJ...819....1I">R. A. Ibata, Lewis, and Martin
(2016)</span> found no statistically significant gap in Palomar 5 tails,
while <span class="citation" data-cites="2017MNRAS.470...60E">Erkal,
Koposov, and Belokurov (2017)</span>, analyzing the same dataset as
<span class="citation" data-cites="2016ApJ...819....1I">R. A. Ibata,
Lewis, and Martin (2016)</span>, suggested the presence of a few dips
and gaps in the tails, at angular distances between <span
class="math inline">\(2^\circ\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(9^\circ\)</span> from the cluster center <span
class="citation" data-cites="2020ApJ...889...70B">(see also Bonaca et
al. 2020)</span>. While our simulations produced 73 gaps across 50
realizations, only about 22 are beyond the current length of the
observed portion of the stream, which means, on average, we obtain at
least one gap from a globular cluster within the past 5 Gyr. However, we
did not attempt to create mock observations or simulate a full detection
process accounting for the challenges of disentangling field stars from
stream stars. While such an analysis would be valuable, it is beyond the
scope of this study.</p>
<p>Our simulations produce a stream for Palomar 5 that is longer than
the currently observed extent. In simulations, stream detections are
straightforward because we can use reference runs to clearly separate
stream particles from the field and compare against a known “true”
structure. In contrast, observational data are inherently more
challenging due to magnitude limits, contamination from field stars, and
the lack of a ground truth for comparison.</p>
<p>The factors mentioned above could lead one to conclude that the
number of gaps identified in this study could represent an upper limit.
However, this conclusion is incomplete. Globular clusters lose mass and
evaporate over time, leading to an incomplete catalog of perturbers.
Moreover, the present-day masses used in our simulations are likely
lower than the historical masses of these clusters. For example, <span
class="citation" data-cites="2024ApJ...976...54P">Pearson et al.
(2024)</span> conducted a study simulating the dissolution of a
realistic globular cluster population to identify how many stellar
streams we should expect in the Milky Way and used a mock catalog of
globular clusters with masses above 10<span class="math inline">\(^4
M_\odot\)</span> totaling about 10,000 clusters. Their setup implies
that more perturbers could have been present in the past, potentially
increasing the frequency and number of gaps in Palomar 5’s stream.</p>
<p>We note that our results seem to be in tension with the conclusions
of <span class="citation" data-cites="2019MNRAS.484.2009B">Banik and
Bovy (2019)</span>, who presented a numerical study of Palomar 5 tails,
orbiting a Milky Way-like potential, where both dark matter subhalos and
baryonic sub-structures (Galactic bar, spiral arms, giant molecular
clouds, globular clusters) were taken into account to quantify the
importance of these latter in density variations in Pal5 streams. While
their methods are extremely similar to ours, their analysis diverges
significantly. Specifically, <span class="citation"
data-cites="2019MNRAS.484.2009B">Banik and Bovy (2019)</span> focused on
examining power spectra, analyzing variations in the one-dimensional
stream density in stellar counts along the length of the stream. Upon
comparison with our simulations, we observe that the power spectra from
our <code>full</code> simulations that include globular clusters and the
<code>reference</code> simulations that do not significantly differ. We
suggest that this may be due to the signal from only one or two gaps
caused by globular clusters not being sufficient to produce notable
differences in the overall power spectrum. Additionally, <span
class="citation" data-cites="2019MNRAS.484.2009B">Banik and Bovy
(2019)</span> may not have inspected the profiles for individual gaps,
which may be why they did not report them. Further investigations would
be needed to confirm this interpretation and thoroughly assess the
impact of globular clusters on stream density profiles.<br />
<span class="citation" data-cites="2017MNRAS.470...60E">Erkal, Koposov,
and Belokurov (2017)</span> also present a study about the impact of
globular clusters in producing gaps on the Pal 5 stream. In section 6.3
of their article, <span class="citation"
data-cites="2017MNRAS.470...60E">Erkal, Koposov, and Belokurov
(2017)</span> discuss the fact that globular clusters with masses
greater than <span class="math inline">\(10^6~\textrm{M}_\odot\)</span>
are rare in the Galaxy, especially at distances compatible with the
orbit of Pal 5, while – based on previous works – they estimate that
subhalos of dark matter of similar mass are at least three times greater
in number. This difference leads them to conclude that the gaps they
report in the Pal 5 streams are more likely to be induced by dark matter
subhalos than by globular clusters.</p>
<p>However, as we show in this paper, even clusters with masses below
<span class="math inline">\(10^6~\textrm{M}\odot\)</span> can produce
gaps. The clusters perturbing the Pal 5 stream are clusters with masses
up to 10 times lower than those considered by <span class="citation"
data-cites="2017MNRAS.470...60E">Erkal, Koposov, and Belokurov
(2017)</span>. It is thus possible that <span class="citation"
data-cites="2017MNRAS.470...60E">Erkal, Koposov, and Belokurov
(2017)</span> have underestimated the impact of globular clusters’ close
passages on a stream such as Pal 5. It is more difficult, however, to
make a comparative analysis between the role of clusters and subhalos at
equal stellar mass. Being less dense than globular clusters, subhalos
should produce less intense perturbations on streams (for fixed impact
parameters and relative velocities). We can derive from <span
class="citation" data-cites="2016MNRAS.457.3817S">Sanders, Bovy, and
Erkal (2016)</span>’s third figure that a more concentrated system
delivers a higher velocity kick but over a shorter distance, while a
more spread out system will affect more stars yet perturb them less. A
systematic comparative analysis to quantify the role of clusters and
subhalos in producing gaps and perturbations in stellar streams still
needs to be done.</p>
<p>The impact of globular clusters’ close interactions with stellar
streams has also been the object of another recent paper by <span
class="citation" data-cites="2022ApJ...941..129D">Doke and Hattori
(2022)</span>, who concluded that the chance for GD-1 gaps, which have
been reported in several works <span class="citation"
data-cites="2019ApJ...880...38B 2018MNRAS.477.1893D 2020AAS...23533607D">(see,
for example, Bonaca et al. 2019; T. J. L. de Boer et al. 2018; T. de
Boer, Gieles, and Erkal 2020)</span> to be produced by globular clusters
is very low. This result is not necessarily in contradiction with ours
since GD-1 has a pericenter which is almost twice that of Palomar 5
<span class="citation" data-cites="2019MNRAS.486.2995M">(see, for
example Malhan and Ibata 2019)</span>. As discussed in Sect. <a
href="#sect:geometry" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sect:geometry">3.3</a>, the number, <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, of close encounters that lead to gap
creation is anti-correlated with the distance <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> to the Galactic center. If we naively
use the same radial dependence of gaps from Palomar 5 for GD-1 by
swapping a pericenter from 6 kpc to 16 kpc, we would reduce the number
of gap-favorable impacts by more than a factor of 2. Moreover, we note
that <span class="citation" data-cites="2022ApJ...941..129D">Doke and
Hattori (2022)</span> pre-selects the globular clusters that could have
experienced a close encounter with the GD-1 stream by selecting only
clusters that pass at a distance of less than 0.5 kpc from the stream,
having a relative velocity smaller than 300 km/s. As shown in our
Fig. <a href="#fig:impact_geometry_statistics" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:impact_geometry_statistics">[fig:impact_geometry_statistics]</a>,
bottom-left panel, in the case of Palomar 5, this choice would lead to
excluding most of the encounters favorable to gap creation, which turn
out to have relative velocities above 300 km/s, reducing the total to
just 19 gaps. It would be interesting to repeat a similar study as the
one made by <span class="citation" data-cites="2022ApJ...941..129D">Doke
and Hattori (2022)</span> for GD-1, imposing no selection on possible
candidate clusters.<br />
As already suggested in previous works which have studied the impact of
baryonic structures on Palomar 5 tails <span class="citation"
data-cites="2017NatAs...1..633P 2019MNRAS.484.2009B">(Pearson,
Price-Whelan, and Johnston 2017; Banik and Bovy 2019)</span>, this
cluster may lie in a region of the phase-space which is not favorable to
distinguish gaps created by dark matter subhalos from gaps created by
baryonic structures, such as the Galactic bar and giant molecular
clouds. Our study shows that close encounters with globular clusters
constitute a further element that confuses a simple interpretation of
the observed Palomar 5 stream gaps (if any). Other clusters and streams
in the orbital energy range of Palomar 5 may suffer from the same
difficulty. Going to lower orbital energies worsens the situation
because the effect of the Galactic bar, giant molecular clouds, and
interactions with globular clusters becomes even more efficient. In the
innermost regions of the Galaxy, where the density of dark matter
subhalos is maximal, globular cluster streams are intrinsically more
difficult to find, in addition to the fact that the dynamical times in
these regions become so small that the stars lost from globular clusters
do not redistribute themselves for the most part into thin structures
<span class="citation" data-cites="2023A&amp;A...673A..44F">(see Ferrone
et al. 2023)</span>. It is thus probably only at larger distances from
the Galactic center than those spanned by Palomar 5’s orbit that the
impact of dark matter subhalos may become dominant, but one should bear
in mind that at these distances, the number density of subhalos also
decreases. In the future, it will be interesting to apply the type of
study conducted here to the whole set of streams to quantify the regime
in which they are favorable to the creation of gaps from baryonic
structures.</p>
<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>Our study demonstrates that globular cluster flybys can produce
density gaps in the stellar streams of Palomar 5. The occurrence and
characteristics of these gaps depend on the stream’s dynamical and
structural properties, the perturber’s mass, and the impact parameter.
While our simulations predict the formation of gaps in Palomar 5’s
tails, the predicted gaps do not align with the regions of the stream
currently observed. Several factors contribute to the absence of
simulated gaps in the observed portions of Palomar 5’s tails, including
the stream’s varying thickness, the dispersion of action frequencies
near the cluster, and the initial conditions adopted in our
simulations.</p>
<p>The broader implications of our findings indicate that globular
cluster interactions add a layer of complexity to interpreting stellar
stream substructures, complicating efforts to distinguish between
baryonic and dark matter-induced gaps. While Palomar 5’s phase-space
region may not be ideal for isolating the impact of dark matter
subhalos, extending this analysis to other streams, particularly those
at larger Galactocentric distances, could provide clearer insights.</p>
<p>Future work should involve a systematic comparison of gap creation
rates across various Galactic potentials and extend the scope to a wider
range of streams and globular clusters. Such a work could disentangle
regimes where baryonic and dark matter-induced substructures can
dominate gap creation, shedding light on the elusive influence of dark
matter subhalos on stellar streams. Additionally, we can continue to add
realistic physics to the Galactic environment, such as the merger of the
Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, the passages of the Large and Small Magellanic
clouds, as well as a time-evolving globular cluster population that
compensates for the clusters’ mass loss, evaporation, and similarly add
members from the current incomplete census.</p>

<p>To construct the 1D density profiles, we binned the data using the
<span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{N}\)</span> rule, where <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is the number of data points (<span
class="math inline">\(N_p = 10^5\)</span>). After binning the 1D
profiles, we apply a median boxcar smoothing technique. At each bin, we
select a number of adjacent data points from both sides, place them in a
list, and replace the central value of the bin with the median. We use
10 adjacent points per side, corresponding to a smoothing length of
approximately 1 kpc. This procedure reduces high-frequency noise and
smooths the profiles. For instance, notice the absence of a high mass
peak indicating the center of mass in the bottom panel of Fig. <a

<p>With the smoothed 1D density profiles in hand, we search regions
where the <code>full</code> simulations are significantly underdense

fluctuations. We first impose a signal-to-noise ratio threshold, <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{SNR}\)</span>. The signal is the log of
the counts per bin from the <code>reference</code> 1D density profile;
we propagate errors assuming a Poisson distribution. We then compute a
threshold for the number of counts in the <code>reference</code>
simulation, <span class="math inline">\(N_v\)</span>, using the
transcendental equation: <span class="math display">\[\mathcal{SNR} =

discarding insignificant bins (i.e., those with counts below the

class="math inline">\(N_{f,i}\)</span> are the counts from the
<code>full</code> simulation, and <span
class="math inline">\(N_{v,i}\)</span> are the counts from the

class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. We then analyze the <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{R}_i\)</span> distribution. If the
differences between the density profiles are primarily due to stochastic
processes of similar magnitude, this distribution should resemble a
Gaussian, as expected from the central limit theorem. Thus, we flag all
regions where the density is underdense by more than two standard
deviations, which should highlight regions whose underdensity is
unlikely to be the result of the sum of stochastic processes but rather
the passage of another globular cluster.</p>
<p>However, this method has its limitations, especially when detecting
smaller gaps. As outlined by <span class="citation"
data-cites="2015MNRAS.450.1136E">Erkal and Belokurov (2015)</span>,
since gap growth is a dispersion phenomenon, a small gap is not
indicative of a weak impact but a recent one. Additionally, since our
streams have finite width, some gaps are oblique with respect to the
stream axis. In such cases, marginalizing over <span
class="math inline">\(y&#39;\)</span> erases the gap’s signal, making it
impossible to detect in a 1D profile. This limitation is particularly
evident in gaps caused by NGC 2808, as discussed in the results.
Therefore, this quantitative analysis serves as an aid to visual
inspection rather than a complete substitute for it. This method helps
with significant, subtle gaps that the eye does not notice in the 2D
maps. <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/15528089">The online
appendix</a> presents these profiles.</p>
<h2 id="sec:Perturber_Identification">Perturber identification</h2>
<p>We aim to identify the origin of the gaps observed at the end of the
simulation. To this end, we examine the evolution of stream density over
time. Instead of using the x’-coordinate, we introduce <span
class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>, which represents time rather than
distance. Specifically, <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>
indicates how long a cluster will take to reach a given point in its
orbit or how long ago it passed. This choice of coordinates is
advantageous because the growth of the stream is approximately linear in
<span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>. In contrast, in physical
space, streams on eccentric orbits expand and contract depending on the
orbital phase.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="2016MNRAS.457.3817S">Sanders,
Bovy, and Erkal (2016)</span> extended the analysis of <span
class="citation" data-cites="2015MNRAS.450.1136E">Erkal and Belokurov
(2015)</span>, demonstrating that action-angle variables provide a
useful coordinate system for analyzing stream evolution, as actions are
conserved quantities and their associated angles grow linearly over
time. Although we became aware of this work only after completing our
analysis, we note that <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> is a
suitable approximation and behaves similarly to the angle variable
corresponding to the azimuthal action: <span class="math inline">\(\tau
\approx \theta_{\phi, i} - \theta_{\phi,\text{GC}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The core of our analysis is presented in Fig. <a
href="#fig:force-on-orbit" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:force-on-orbit">[fig:force-on-orbit]</a>. The bottom
panel shows the evolution of the stream density over time. To avoid
extremely low-density regions at the stream’s edges, we applied the same
density threshold as from Eq. <a href="#eq:density_threshold"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="eq:density_threshold">[eq:density_threshold]</a> to
focus on the more significant areas of the stream. Next, we modeled
Palomar 5’s orbit as a proxy for its stream and sampled points along the
orbit to measure the gravitational force exerted by other globular
clusters. The top panel of Fig. <a href="#fig:force-on-orbit"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:force-on-orbit">[fig:force-on-orbit]</a> shows how
the total gravitational acceleration on Palomar 5’s stream evolves over
its length throughout the simulation.</p>
<div class="figure*">
<p><img src="images/force_on_orbit-monte-carlo-009.png"

</div>
<p>We then used <code>scipy</code>’s <code>ndimage</code> <span
class="citation" data-cites="2020NatMe..17..261V">(Virtanen et al.
2020)</span> package to identify the top five local maxima in the data
space of gravitational acceleration <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{g}\)</span> as a function of time <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and the stream coordinate <span
class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>. First, we smooth the data space by
taking a 5-point moving average kernel. Secondly, we use a maximum
filter to locate coordinates in the (<span
class="math inline">\(t,\tau\)</span>) data plane that are local maxima
to at least 10 adjacent data points. We order these locations and save
the top five strongest interactions. Then, we iterated over the
contributions of individual globular clusters to determine which cluster
contributed the most to each peak in <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{g}\)</span>. We label each significant peak
with the corresponding globular cluster.</p>
<p>Afterward, we cross-referenced these peaks with the locations of the
gaps identified by studying the density maps and profiles from Fig. <a
href="#fig:profiles" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:profiles">[fig:profiles]</a>. The impact leaves a
low-density wake in the (<span class="math inline">\(t,\tau\)</span>)
plane for large gaps resulting from strong interactions. the bottom
panel of Fig. <a href="#fig:force-on-orbit" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:force-on-orbit">[fig:force-on-orbit]</a> shows the
wakes corresponding to the impacts of NGC 104 and NGC 7808.</p>
<p>Fig. <a href="#fig:force-on-orbit" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:force-on-orbit">[fig:force-on-orbit]</a> contains
some interesting information. Notice the periodic ribbons of force in
the <span class="math inline">\((t,\tau)\)</span> plane. The ribbons are
due to pericenter passages where Palomar 5 is getting closer to the
center of mass of the globular cluster system. Additionally, for the
impacts of NGC 104 and NGC 7078, wakes can be observed in the density
map. Another important aspect is that the strongest peak in
gravitational force does not necessarily create a gap. Notice how
NGC 5272, which was labeled with 0 to indicate that it has the greatest
local maxima, does not have a gap. The reason for this is manifold. For
instance, the force needs to be modulated with time since the change in
momentum is the determining factor and not the peak magnitude of the
force. Additionally, there is an offset of about 200 pc between the
stream and the orbit, as seen when viewing the stream in tail
coordinates, so peaks upon the orbit are good proxies for the stream but
are not definitive. We found that the top five greatest impacts
accounted for all gaps, except for Sampling 014 as shown in Fig. 3 of
our extended list of <a href="10.5281/zenodo.15528089">figures</a>,
whose gap from NGC 6584 corresponded to the 7th peak.</p>
<p>We compile the results of this analysis into a table. Each row of the
table corresponds to a gap; its corresponding suspects are the columns.
The culprit is labeled as <code>TRUE</code>. For a handful of
simulations, to double-check that we make the correct verdict, we
recompute the simulations, yet individually adding one globular cluster
at a time. As a result, we can confirm that singular gaps arise from the
suspected clusters. Fig. <a href="#fig:decomposition"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:decomposition">[fig:decomposition]</a> shows one
such example.</p>
<h2 id="sec:reconstruction">Reconstruction of the impact geometry</h2>
<p>As discussed in Sect <a href="#sect:geometry"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sect:geometry">3.3</a>, five
parameters determine the change in velocity of a given stream particle:
<span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(r_p\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(W_\parallel\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(W_\perp\)</span>. In the following, we describe
how we estimated these parameters during impacts in our simulations.</p>
<p>To achieve this, we identify the impact of the most significant
clusters, as determined in the previous analysis in Sec. <a
href="#sec:Perturber_Identification" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:Perturber_Identification">6.2</a>. Then, we refine
these estimates to pinpoint the exact location of the impact along the
stream and the precise moment it occurred. To do so, we fit a
third-order parametric polynomial to the stream using the saved
snapshots from our simulations:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\vec{s}(\tau) =
            \left\{
            \begin{aligned}
                x(\tau) &amp;= a_0 + a_1 \tau + a_2 \tau^2 + a_3 \tau^3
\\
                y(\tau) &amp;= b_0 + b_1 \tau + b_2 \tau^2 + b_3 \tau^3
\\
                z(\tau) &amp;= c_0 + c_1 \tau + c_2 \tau^2 + c_3 \tau^3,
            \end{aligned}
            \right.\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> represent the parametric line
describing the stream in Galactocentric coordinates, <span
class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> is the stream coordinate in time as
described in the Appendix <a href="#sec:Perturber_Identification"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:Perturber_Identification">6.2</a>, and is used as
the independent variable to parameterize the position along the stream.
The coefficients <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(b_i\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(c_i\)</span> are the polynomial coefficients. We
found that a second-order polynomial was insufficient to capture the
curvature along the full length of the stream, with divergence at the
ends of the tails. A third-order polynomial was sufficient and
desirable, as the lowest order adequately captures the stream’s path
over the entire length under consideration.</p>
<p>In this analysis, we only consider one side of the stream. For
instance, if the impact candidate was in the leading tail, only the star
particles with <span class="math inline">\(\tau &gt; 0\)</span> are used
to constrain the stream track. The polynomial coefficients were
determined through a minimization method using the Nelder-Mead algorithm
from <code>scipy</code>’s optimization package.</p>
<p>Since we saved the simulation snapshots at a temporal resolution of
1 Myr–rather than at the integration time-step, which would have
generated excessive data, we must interpolate between snapshots to more
precisely estimate the impact geometry. We fit the stream’s shape with a
parametric third-order polynomial at the five time steps surrounding the
approximate impact time. This time is a period of 5 Myr, sufficiently
covering the interaction time. The interaction time can be estimated as
<span class="math inline">\(t \approx
\frac{100~\text{pc}}{300~\frac{\text{km}}{\text{s}}} \approx
0.3~\text{Myr}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Then, we used a cubic spline interpolation for the coefficients
describing the stream’s shape, which allows us to describe each
polynomial coefficient as a function of time. Consequently, we can
parameterize the stream as a function of both simulation time and
position along the stream: <span class="math display">\[\vec{s}(t,\tau)
=
            \left\{
            \begin{aligned}
            x(t,\tau) &amp;= a_0(t) + a_1(t)\tau + a_2(t) \tau^2 +
a_3(t)\tau^3 \\
            y(t,\tau) &amp;= b_0(t) + b_1(t)\tau + b_2(t) \tau^2 +
b_3(t)\tau^3 \\
            z(t,\tau) &amp;= c_0(t) + c_1(t)\tau + c_2(t) \tau^2 +
c_3(t)\tau^3.
            \end{aligned}
            \right.\]</span></p>
<p>The values of the coefficients as a function of time are obtained
through linear interpolation, ensuring that the coefficients at the
snapshot times match the values constrained by the simulation data.</p>
<p>Next, we fit the trajectory of the perturber with a second-order
polynomial. With equations for both the stream and the perturber as
functions of time, we identify the time and location of impact by
minimizing a cost function, defined as the distance between the stream
and the perturber: <span class="math display">\[b(t, \tau) = \left\lVert
\vec{s}(t, \tau) - \vec{p}(t) \right\rVert,\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{s}(t, \tau)\)</span> is the Galactocentric
position of a point on the stream, <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{p}(t)\)</span> is the position of the
perturber, and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is the distance
between the two. The minimum value of <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, denoted as <span
class="math inline">\(\text{min}(b)\)</span>, represents the impact
parameter. We performed the minimization using <code>scipy</code>’s
optimization package with the <code>L-BFGS-B</code> method, which
allowed us to place bounds on <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>, ensuring no extrapolation
occurs <span class="citation" data-cites="davidon1991variable">(Davidon
1991)</span>.</p>
<p>Once this minimization is done, determining the relative velocity
becomes straightforward. Since the minimization provides the impact
parameter, time of impact, and the corresponding value of <span
class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>, we can compute the derivatives of
the parametric equations at <span
class="math inline">\(t_{\text{min}}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\tau_{\text{min}}\)</span>. The parallel and
perpendicular components of the perturber’s velocity relative to the
stream are given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
            \delta \vec{v} &amp;=\vec{v_p} - \vec{v_s}, \\
            w_\parallel &amp;= \left(\delta \vec{v}\right)\cdot
\hat{v_s},\\  
            w_\perp &amp;=  \sqrt{\Delta v ^2 - w_\parallel ^ 2},
            \end{aligned}\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{v}_p\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{v}_s\)</span> are the velocities of the
perturber and the stream, respectively. We compute the strongest five
flybys for each of the 50 simulations. Thus, we created a sample of 250
impacts and flagged those that give rise to gaps. We refer the reader to

<p>In Section <a href="#sec:mass_loss" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:mass_loss">2.2</a>, we emphasized that the
conditions chosen to simulate the formation and evolution of streams
around Pal 5 are probably unrealistic. By choosing, as we did, the same
values for the mass and size of the cluster 5 billion years ago as the
cluster has today, we did not take into account the loss of mass and
internal evolution of the cluster over time. In particular, the velocity
dispersion of the stars in a cluster and the velocity dispersion of the
stars leaving the cluster and entering the stream depend on the
cluster’s mass. It is therefore legitimate to ask whether, using a
progenitor with a different mass and/or size, the gaps survive and
whether, in particular, gaps formed several billion years ago can still
be visible today.</p>
<p>While we anticipate that a specific study on this aspect is in
preparation (Ferrone et al., in prep), we would like to preview a few
results here, particularly regarding the gap decoherence phenomenon
presented in Fig. <a href="#fig:decoherence_shocked_outflow"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:decoherence_shocked_outflow">5</a>. First, Fig. <a
href="#fig:gap_no_more" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:gap_no_more">[fig:gap_no_more]</a> shows two streams
with the same orbital parameters that were impacted by NGC 7078. The top
panel shows a stream originating from a host mass of <span
class="math inline">\(10,000\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(M_\odot\)</span>, while in the second panel we
increased the mass to <span
class="math inline">\(\sim40,000\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(M_\odot\)</span>. For simplicity, both clusters
have the same half-mass radius of 27 pc. The encounter occurred about
two and a half billion years ago with NGC 7078, which has a mass of
<span class="math inline">\(5.16\times10^{5}~M_\odot\)</span>. The gap
persists for the lighter host, yet is barely visible in the case of the
more massive host.</p>
<p>Fig. <a href="#fig:decoherence_shocked_outflow"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:decoherence_shocked_outflow">5</a> dissects the more
massive stream of Fig. <a href="#fig:gap_no_more"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:gap_no_more">[fig:gap_no_more]</a> and explains why
the gap does not persist. The bottom panel shows the total density
distribution, decomposed into two profiles: stars that are either leaked
or shocked out of the cluster. By shocked, we mean stars that are lost
during pericenter passages. Tidal forces generally scale with <span
class="math inline">\(r^{-3}\)</span>, and thus significantly intensify
during pericenter passages (see Fig. 3 of <span class="citation"
data-cites="2004AJ....127.2753D">Dehnen et al. (2004)</span> for an
illustration of the magnitude of tidal forces along an orbit). A
consequence of these passages is that many more stars escape, fleeing
with higher mean velocity and velocity dispersion—this can be visualized
in the “Christmas tree” illustration in Fig. A.3 of <span
class="citation"
data-cites="2012A&amp;A...546L...7M">Mastrobuono-Battisti et al.
(2012)</span>. We consider the continuous outflow of stars between
pericenter passages to be leaked stars. We identify pericenter passages
by computing each local minimum of the cluster’s Galactocentric 3D
radius using <code>scipy.signal.find_peaks</code>. The duration of each
shock is given by <span class="math inline">\(t_{\textrm{shock}} =
2\sqrt{r/|\nabla\Phi|}\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is the Galactocentric radius and <span
class="math inline">\(|\nabla\Phi|\)</span> is the magnitude of the
acceleration from the Galactic potential. Stars within this time range
around a given pericenter passage are all given the same color and shown
as individual groups in the first through fourth panels of Fig. <a
