<p>The most accurate model of the Palomar 5 stream would involve full
modeling of the internal dynamics of the cluster, which would mean
computing <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>-body interactions with
a <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}(N^2)\)</span> computation
time, stellar evolution, supernovae, an initial mass distribution,
treatment of binary star systems, etc. <span class="citation"
data-cites="2021NatAs...5..957G 2016MNRAS.458.1450W">(for such an
example, see Gieles et al. 2021; Wang et al. 2016)</span>. Instead, we
opt for solving the restricted-three-body problem, also known as the
particle-test method, as we did for <span class="citation"
data-cites="2023A&amp;A...673A..44F">Ferrone et al. (2023)</span>, which
we describe here for completeness. As demonstrated by <span
class="citation"
data-cites="2012A&amp;A...546L...7M">Mastrobuono-Battisti et al.
(2012)</span>, although the restricted three-body problem neglects the
internal evolution of the cluster, it still reproduces very similar
stream properties since the model captures key extracluster physics,
such as disk shocking and epicyclic stripping.<br />
Below, we first present the approach used to include the Galactic
globular cluster system in our modeling (Sect. <a href="#numerical_meth"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="numerical_meth">2.1</a>),
highlighting the similarities and differences with respect to what we
did in <span class="citation"
data-cites="2023A&amp;A...673A..44F">Ferrone et al. (2023)</span>; we
then summarize the method used to model the mass loss from the cluster
(Sect. <a href="#sec:mass_loss" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:mass_loss">2.2</a>) and finally discuss the quality
of the numerical integration (Sect. <a href="#num_quality"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="num_quality">2.3</a>).</p>
<h2 id="numerical_meth">Numerical methodology</h2>
<p>We begin by extracting positions in the sky, proper motions,
line-of-sight velocities, and distances, as well as masses and half-mass
radii, of 165 globular clusters from the Galactic globular cluster
catalog by <span class="citation"
data-cites="2021MNRAS.505.5957B">(Baumgardt and Vasiliev 2021)</span>.<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> We then convert the initial
conditions from sky coordinates into a Galactocentric reference frame,
by adopting a velocity for the local standard of rest of <span
class="math inline">\(v_{\text{LSR}} = 240\)</span> km s<span
class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> and a peculiar velocity of the Sun
equal to <span class="math inline">\((U_\odot, V_\odot, W_\odot)=(11.1,
12.24, 7.25)\)</span> km s<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span>, as
reported by <span class="citation"
data-cites="2012MNRAS.427..274S">Schönrich (2012)</span>. We set the
Sun’s position to <span class="math inline">\((x_\odot,y_\odot,z_\odot)
= (-8.34,0,0.027)\)</span> kpc. We took the vertical position above the
disk from <span class="citation" data-cites="2001ApJ...553..184C">Chen
et al. (2001)</span> and the distance of the Sun to the Galactic center
from <span class="citation" data-cites="2014ApJ...783..130R">Reid et al.
(2014)</span>. These transformations were performed using
<code>astropy</code> <span class="citation"
data-cites="2013A&amp;A...558A..33A">(Astropy Collaboration et al.
2013)</span>.</p>
<p>For the Galactic potential, we employed the second model from <span
class="citation" data-cites="2017A&amp;A...598A..66P">Pouliasis, Di
Matteo, and Haywood (2017)</span>, a superposition of a thin disk, thick
disk, and dark matter halo, with masses and scale lengths provided in
Table 1 of <span class="citation"
data-cites="2023A&amp;A...673A..44F">Ferrone et al. (2023)</span>. This
model is time-independent throughout our simulations. This model
satisfies a series of observational constraints such as local solar,
stellar density, the Galactic rotation curve, similarly to other
Galactic models such as <code>MWpotential2014</code> from <span
class="citation" data-cites="2015ApJS..216...29B">Bovy (2015)</span> and
<code>McMillian2017</code> from <span class="citation"
data-cites="2017MNRAS.465...76M">McMillan (2017)</span>. However, we use
only one Galactic potential to balance data volume and computation time,
which should suffice. <span class="citation"
data-cites="2021MNRAS.505.5978V">Vasiliev and Baumgardt (2021)</span>
found that only a few outer globular clusters are strongly affected by
different potential models. Generally, kinematic uncertainties are the
dominant factor in differences between orbital solutions per cluster.
Similarly, <span class="citation"
data-cites="2024MNRAS.528.5189G">Grondin et al. (2024)</span> generated
a globular cluster mass-loss catalog using seven different potential
models and found that their debris distributions were rather
model-independent, similar to those of <span class="citation"
data-cites="2023A&amp;A...673A..44F">Ferrone et al. (2023)</span>. While
the clusters’ exact positions in time may depend on the model, we assert
that interaction rates and stream formation are largely independent of
the choice of the Galactic potential model.</p>
<p>Lastly, we select an integration time of 5 Gyr as a compromise
between maximizing interaction statistics and modeling the Galaxy as a
time-independent, constant mass distribution. <span class="citation"
data-cites="2023A&amp;A...673A.152I">Ishchenko et al. (2023)</span>
analyzed the orbits of the Galactic cluster population using the same
initial conditions as in this work within five live Milky Way-like
potentials from IllustrisTNG <span class="citation"
data-cites="2018MNRAS.473.4077P">(Pillepich et al. 2018)</span>. They
found that in all sampled potentials, orbital changes remain minimal
over 5 Gyr, becoming significant only at earlier look-back times when
the host galaxy had significantly less mass or was undergoing a merger
event.</p>
<h3 id="full-simulations"> <code>Full</code> simulations</h3>
<p>There is a primary methodological departure from <span
class="citation" data-cites="2023A&amp;A...673A..44F">Ferrone et al.
(2023)</span>. In that work, globular clusters evolved under the
gravitational effect of the Galaxy alone. In contrast, now we also
consider the effect of all other Galactic globular clusters by taking
into account the direct <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>-body
interactions between them. First, all clusters are represented by
Plummer spheres, each with its own mass and half-mass radius as reported
in the Baumgardt catalog <span class="citation"
data-cites="2021MNRAS.505.5957B">(Baumgardt and Vasiliev 2021)</span>.
For the remainder of this paper, the <code>full</code> simulations
consider the gravitational forces from the globular cluster
interactions.<br />
For these simulations, we proceeded in two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>First, starting from the Galactocentric positions and velocities
of all 165 Galactic globular clusters, we integrate their orbits back in
time for 5 Gyr under the influence of the Galaxy itself and their mutual
influence. In the backward integration, the system of equations of
motion for the globular clusters is thus: <span
class="math display">\[\ddot{\vec{r}}_i = -\nabla \Phi +
\left.\sum_{j\neq i}^{N_{GC}} \frac{Gm_j}{\left(|\vec{r}_j -
\vec{r}_i|^2 + b_j^2\right)^{3/2}}\right. \left(\vec{r}_j -
\vec{r}_i\right),\]</span><span id="eq:GCNBody"
data-label="eq:GCNBody"></span> where <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{r}\)</span> indicates the Galactocentric
position vector, the index <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>
indicates the globular cluster of interest; the index <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span> indicates the other globular clusters
that are summed over. <span class="math inline">\(N_{GC}\)</span> is the
total number of globular clusters, which in this study is 165, <span
class="math inline">\(m_j\)</span> is the mass of the j-th cluster in
the sample, <span class="math inline">\(b_j\)</span> is its Plummer
scale radius, and <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r_j}\)</span> is its
Galactocentric position. <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span>
represents the same Galactic smooth potential that we discussed
previously <span class="citation"
data-cites="2017A&amp;A...598A..66P">(Pouliasis, Di Matteo, and Haywood
2017, Model II, in the present case)</span>. Note that the masses and
sizes of the globular clusters are kept constant in these simulations
and are not allowed to vary with time, which means that we do not
consider their internal evolution. In sec. <a href="#sec:discussion"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:discussion">[sec:discussion]</a>, we discuss the
implications of the modeling limitations.</p></li>
<li><p>Once we found the positions and velocities of the entire globular
cluster, we sampled Palomar 5 with 100,000 particles from a Plummer
distribution, taking the mass and half-mass radius from the Baumgardt
catalog: <span
class="math inline">\(1.3\times10^{4}~\textrm{M}_\odot\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(27.6~\textrm{pc}\)</span>. We then
integrated the evolution of these particles forward in time to the
present day, taking into account that each particle feels the
gravitational potential of the Galaxy, its host cluster, and that of all
the other clusters in the Galaxy. Note that we do not account for
self-gravity among particles. The particles experience the gravitational
field yet do not contribute to it, a common assumption in galactic
dynamics, as the mass of an individual star is negligible compared to
the mass of the larger dynamical system. The equation of motion of a
generic particle among the 100,000 that populate Palomar 5 is thus:
<span class="math display">\[\ddot{\vec{r}}_p = -\nabla \Phi +
\left.\sum_{j}^{N_{GC}} \frac{Gm_j}{\left(|\vec{r}_j(t) - \vec{r}_p|^2 +
b_j^2\right)^{3/2}}\right. \left(\vec{r}_j(t)-
\vec{r}_p\right),\]</span> <span id="eq:equation_of_motion_particle"
data-label="eq:equation_of_motion_particle"></span> where the index
<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> represents one of the 100,000
particles of interest, <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r_p}\)</span>
being its position, and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> indexes
over the globular clusters as in Eq. <a href="#eq:GCNBody"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:GCNBody">[eq:GCNBody]</a>.
We note that in Eq. <a href="#eq:equation_of_motion_particle"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="eq:equation_of_motion_particle">[eq:equation_of_motion_particle]</a>,
the positions of the globular clusters are time-dependent since they are
being loaded during this step and not computed, unlike Eq. <a
href="#eq:GCNBody" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="eq:GCNBody">[eq:GCNBody]</a>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The procedure described so far has been repeated 50 times, generating
a new set of initial conditions each time, given the uncertainties on
proper motions, line-of-sight velocities, distances to the Sun, and
masses of all clusters, as reported in the Baumgardt catalog. We handle
these uncertainties through a Monte-Carlo approach by sampling them with
a Gaussian distribution and considering the covariance term between the
proper motions. We use the most probable values for the initial
conditions in the first simulation. We sample the uncertainties for all
globular clusters. Additionally, for each resampling of Palomar 5’s
mass, we also resample the distribution of the 100,000 star
particles.</p>
<p>During the integration, we save intermediate snapshots to facilitate
the analysis of stellar streams and the effects of cluster impacts.
Specifically, for each realization of the Palomar 5 stream, we saved
<span class="math inline">\(5000\)</span> in snapshots, equivalent to a
temporal resolution of 1 million years. We provide the parameters that
specify our data volume in Table <a href="#tab:data_volume"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab:data_volume">1</a>. Using
single precision floating point numbers, the size of our simulations is
approximately: <span

<h3 id="reference-simulations"> <code>Reference</code> simulations</h3>
<p>To quantify the impact of globular cluster passages on the density of
the Palomar 5 stream, we performed a second set of simulations, which we
refer to as the <code>reference</code> simulations in this paper. These
<code>reference</code> simulations use the same 50 sets of initial
conditions as the <code>full</code> simulations, the same Galactic
potential, but exclude mutual interactions between globular clusters.
The approach adopted for this second set of simulations is thus
equivalent to that adopted already in <span class="citation"
data-cites="2023A&amp;A...673A..44F">Ferrone et al. (2023)</span>. In
Eq. <a href="#eq:GCNBody" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="eq:GCNBody">[eq:GCNBody]</a>, only the gradient of the
Galactic potential is considered. In Eq. <a
href="#eq:equation_of_motion_particle" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="eq:equation_of_motion_particle">[eq:equation_of_motion_particle]</a>,
of the second term on the right side of the equation, only the influence
of Palomar 5’s Plummer sphere on Palomar 5’s particles is considered. In
other words, the sum iterates over only one globular cluster, the host.
We omit all interactions with the other clusters.</p>
<h2 id="sec:mass_loss">Mass loss</h2>
<p>Each of the 100,000 particles that initially populate the cluster
undergoes experiences the forces from Pal 5 and the Galactic potential.
The mass and radius of Pal 5 are held constant over time. At each time
step, a certain number of particles will therefore acquire sufficient
energy to no longer be gravitationally bound to the cluster itself and
thus go on to populate the streams, whose mass and spatial extent grow
over time. It is important to note that in the approach used:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The masses and sizes of the clusters (and therefore the
parameters of the Plummer potentials) do not change over time, which is
an oversimplification, because in a self-consistent approach, these
parameters would vary.</p></li>
<li><p>We use the same initial conditions for Pal 5 progenitor as it has
today, and this is also a simplification, since Pal 5 - 5 Gyr years ago
- must have contained at least part of the mass estimated today in its
tails<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The assumption in point 2 is a direct consequence of the approach
described in point 1. Starting from a cluster with a mass and size
similar to the current ones can lead to streams with lower velocity
dispersions than those we would obtain if we had used a self-consistent
approach. In a future article, we will report on the study of gap
survival times depending on the masses and sizes of progenitor clusters
(Ferrone et al, in prep). We note, however, that simplifications of this
kind are not uncommon in literature. <span class="citation"
data-cites="2017NatAs...1..633P">Pearson, Price-Whelan, and Johnston
(2017)</span> discussed the formation of gaps in the Pal 5 tails and
assumed a time-independent mass of <span class="math inline">\(50,000
~\textrm{M}_\odot\)</span> for Pal 5, over the last 4 Gyr; <span
class="citation" data-cites="2017MNRAS.470...60E">Erkal, Koposov, and
Belokurov (2017)</span> adopted a N-body approach to simulate Pal 5

the Pal 5 stream as emerging from a stellar system with a velocity
dispersion of 0.5 km/s (similar to that of particles escaping from our
cluster, as we have verified).</p>
<p>The characteristics of the streams modeled in this paper may be
considered more representative of those of clusters that are now
completely dispersed, i.e., it is conceivable that completely dispersed
globular clusters that left behind a population of ‘orphan’ streams
passed through characteristics similar to those of Pal 5 today (small
masses and extended radii). In this sense, the initial conditions chosen
(in terms of internal parameters) may be more representative of those of
streams for which the progenitor is now dissolved <span class="citation"

streams without progenitors described by R. Ibata et al. 2024)</span>

currently typical of Galactic globular clusters. <a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="num_quality">Numerical stability</h2>
<p>We used a leapfrog integrator because of its ability to preserve
phase-space volume and conserve the Hamiltonian with each integration
step. For instance, this method is preferable to a Runge-Kutta scheme,
which can introduce non-physical and significant numerical errors in
systems that require long-term stability and energy conservation. One
drawback of the leapfrog integrator is that it requires a uniform time
step throughout the entire computation, resulting in unnecessary
computations for a particle after it has escaped from the host cluster.
However, energy conservation and phase-space volume preservation are
paramount when modeling stellar streams. The time step was therefore set
to be small enough to conserve energy for the most interior particles
within the cluster—ensuring that a higher mass loss did not arise from
numerical error. We found that a time-step of 10,000 years was adequate
to maintain energy conservation, with a median variation of <span
class="math inline">\(10^{-12} \frac{\Delta E}{E_0}\)</span>, where
<span class="math inline">\(E_0\)</span> is a particle’s initial energy,
and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta E\)</span> is the difference
between its final and initial energy.</p>
<p>We also checked the reverse integrability of the globular cluster
system for the <code>reference</code> simulations. By reverse
integrability, we mean the integrator’s capability to track the cluster
backward in time and then re-integrate it forward along the same
trajectory. Integrating point masses in a static axis-symmetric
potential conserves <span class="math inline">\(L_z\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, which create regular periodic and
non-chaotic orbits. Therefore, any drift would arise from purely
numerical error. We selected a timestamp for which the drift in the
final position after forward integration, compared to the initial
position from the backward integration, was consistently at least two
orders of magnitude smaller than the Plummer scale radius used for
Palomar 5. This high precision ensures that no fictitious numerical
forces influence the system, preventing any artificial mass loss or
retention of star particles.</p>

<p>The presence of the other globular clusters affects the properties of
the Palomar 5 stream. Fig. <a href="#fig:stream_on_sky"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:stream_on_sky">[fig:stream_on_sky]</a> presents an
obvious example of this effect, which we selected for its prominent
gaps. Two of these gaps are visible in Galactic coordinates and become
even more apparent when marginalizing over latitude to reconstruct the
1D density profile of the stream as a function of longitude.</p>
<p>Regarding the shape of the density distribution, the central peak
corresponds to the still-intact globular cluster whose stars have not
yet escaped. The stream’s density peaks are of the same order as the
cluster itself, which is inconsistent with reality; the cluster’s peak
density should be higher than that of the stream. Of course, this
discrepancy is a result of our modeling choices. Since we use the
present-day mass and radius for Palomar 5 for the whole simulation
duration, the system is less dense than it should have been. In turn,
our simulations have a strong initial mass loss, which adds to the
amplitudes of the profile density peaks of Fig. <a
href="#fig:stream_on_sky" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:stream_on_sky">[fig:stream_on_sky]</a>. This
inaccuracy is acceptable for the scope of this work. First, Palomar 5’s
tails indeed have more mass than the cluster itself. <span
class="citation" data-cites="2017ApJ...842..120I">R. A. Ibata et al.
(2017)</span> reports that there could be three times as much mass in
Palomar 5’s tails as the cluster itself. Secondly, the exact form of the
density distribution is less important than having a population of
particles present that can probe a cluster flyby event.</p>
<p>To compare the <code>reference</code> and <code>full</code>
simulations more quantitatively, we work in the tail coordinate system,
in which the stream’s central axis aligns with the cluster’s orbit. We
based this coordinate system on the work of <span class="citation"
data-cites="2004AJ....127.2753D">Dehnen et al. (2004)</span> and present
it in Fig. <a href="#fig:TailCoordinates" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:TailCoordinates">[fig:TailCoordinates]</a>. Briefly,
in this system, the <span
class="math inline">\(x_{\textrm{tail}}\)</span> coordinate represents
the position of a particle along the orbit relative to the globular
cluster. Positive values of <span
class="math inline">\(x_{\textrm{tail}}\)</span> are ahead of the
cluster, while negative <span
class="math inline">\(x_{\textrm{tail}}\)</span> is behind the cluster.
The <span class="math inline">\(y_{\textrm{tail}}\)</span> coordinate
measures the particle’s distance within the orbital plane, where
positive values indicate that the particle is farther from the Galactic
center and negative values indicate that it is closer. Fig. <a
href="#fig:decomposition" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:decomposition">[fig:decomposition]</a> shows a
comparison between one of the 50 realizations of the Palomar 5 stream,
taking into account the gravitational interactions with all other
globular clusters in the Galaxy (top panel) and omitting them (bottom
panel). This comparison clearly shows the presence of two wide (<span
class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span>100 pc and <span
class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span>1 kpc) gaps in the leading tail and
of a more subtle underdensity at <span
class="math inline">\(x_{\textrm{tail}}\sim 5\)</span> kpc (we refer the
reader to Appendix <a href="#sec:gap_detection"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:gap_detection">[sec:gap_detection]</a> for a
detailed description of the underdensities and gaps detection
method).</p>
<p>To determine which globular clusters were responsible for creating
these gaps and when close passages occurred, we estimated the
gravitational acceleration along the orbit of Palomar 5. We represented
it in the (<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>) space. <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is the simulation time, and <span
class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> indicates how long it will take for
Palomar 5 to reach a given point in its orbit or how long ago it passed.
The use of <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> is advantageous
because the growth of the stream is approximately linear in <span
class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, streams in physical space are modulated by their
orbital eccentricity with periodic expansion and contraction depending
on the orbital phase <span class="citation"
data-cites="2016MNRAS.457.3817S">(see the top panel of Fig. 5. Sanders,
Bovy, and Erkal 2016, for an example)</span>. Adopting this time-space
and reporting the gravitational acceleration along the Palomar 5 orbit
in this space, identifying the globular clusters that produced the
perturbation and the time at which it occurred becomes straightforward.
We refer the reader to Appendix <a href="#sec:Perturber_Identification"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:Perturber_Identification">[sec:Perturber_Identification]</a>
for a detailed description of the procedure. In this way, we can
identify that the clusters responsible for creating gaps in the
simulation of the Palomar 5 stream, as reported in Fig. <a
href="#fig:decomposition" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:decomposition">[fig:decomposition]</a>, are
NGC 2808, NGC 7078, and NGC 104. Their close passages occurred 200 Myr,
-1.9, and -2.1 Gyr ago, respectively.</p>
<p>To further investigate whether the three clusters above are
responsible for producing the gaps observed in this simulation, we
conducted additional experiments by including only the perturbation of
each cluster at a time, while neglecting the gravitational perturbations
of all the other clusters in the Galaxy.</p>
<p>To verify that the three suspected clusters are responsible for
producing the gaps, we conducted experiments by including one perturbed
at a time and excluding all others. We present these results in the
middle panels of Fig. <a href="#fig:decomposition"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:decomposition">[fig:decomposition]</a> and clearly
show that NGC 2808, NGC 7078, and NGC 104 are the clusters responsible
for creating the underdense regions observed in the leading tails of
Palomar 5. It is worth noting that the times at which the passages of
these clusters occurred, according to our analysis, are in agreement
with the observed width of the corresponding gaps: the encounter with
NGC 2808 being very recent (only 200 Myr ago), its induced gap is still
very thin, because it takes time for a perturbation to grow into an
extended gap, as it is the case for those induced by the passages of
NGC 7078 and NGC 104, which occurred in earlier times. It is also
interesting to emphasize that gaps as thin as those generated by the
passage of NGC 2808, 200 Myr ago, can be detected by working in the tail
coordinate system and by making a comparative analysis
(<code>full</code> versus <code>reference</code> simulations): they are
so thin that they cannot be directly identified in Galactic coordinates
(see Fig. <a href="#fig:stream_on_sky" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:stream_on_sky">[fig:stream_on_sky]</a>).<br />
The analysis presented in Fig. <a href="#fig:decomposition"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:decomposition">[fig:decomposition]</a> has been
repeated for the whole set of simulations, and <a
href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15528089">online appendix</a>
reports all of them for completeness. For all the streams,
morphologically speaking, the only changes appear to be the existence of
gaps or their absence. We do not observe a thickening of the streams due
to an increased velocity dispersion.</p>
<p>From this analysis, we can derive a statistical view of (1) the
number of gaps generated on the Palomar 5 stream by the system of
Galactic globular clusters, (2) the clusters that generated these gaps,
and the time history of these perturbations. From this, we can then
quantify (3) the properties of the perturbers (their masses, sizes, and
orbital parameters) as well as (4) the impact geometry of the
encounters, which allows us to understand which encounters are more
favorable for generating gaps in the Palomar 5 stream. In the following,
we will present the results of this analysis, addressing points (1) and
(2).</p>
<h2 id="sect:history">The history and statistics of gap creations in the
Palomar 5 stream</h2>
<p>By applying the methodology described above to the whole set of
simulations, we can reconstruct the history of close passages of
Galactic globular clusters to Palomar 5’s stream in the last 5 Gyr,
which – we remind the reader – is the time interval investigated in our
simulations. Fig. <a href="#fig:histogram_impact_time"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:histogram_impact_time">[fig:histogram_impact_time]</a>
and Table <a href="#tab:gaps_per_perturber" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="tab:gaps_per_perturber">2</a> present results of this
analysis. NGC 2808 impacted Palomar 5’s stream about 200 Myr ago in 44
out of 50 simulations, creating a small gap at a similar position to the
one reported in Fig. <a href="#fig:decomposition"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:decomposition">[fig:decomposition]</a> in each case.
Since this interaction occurred less than one orbital period ago,
despite the uncertainties, the orbital solutions remain similar and thus
produce consistent results across all simulations. However, as we
continue to turn back time further, the uncertainties in the initial
conditions allow the various orbital solutions to diverge from one
another. Thus, in one configuration, a cluster can impact the stream at
a given time, and yet at the same moment, in a different set of initial
conditions, it could be on the other side of the Galaxy. We will discuss
the necessary conditions for creating a gap in Appendix <a
href="#sec:gaps_vs_gcmass" data-reference-type="ref"

<p>We need a more sophisticated statistic to compare our results to
other simulations, so we turn to the gap creation rate developed by
<span class="citation" data-cites="2012ApJ...748...20C">Carlberg
(2012)</span>. The gap creation rate is the number of gaps that appear
per unit time and is normalized by the stream’s length. For our
simulations, this rate is given by: <span
class="math display">\[\label{eq:gap_creation_rate}
\mathcal{R}_{\textrm{Pal 5}} =  \frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^T l^{-1}(t) \sum_i
\delta(t-t_i) dt,\]</span>where <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>
is the total integration time, <span class="math inline">\(l(t)\)</span>
is the length of the stream, and <span class="math inline">\(\sum_i
\delta(t-t_i)\)</span> sums over the gap occurrences, with <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span> indexing over the number of gaps in a
given simulation. Here, <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span>
represents the Dirac delta function. This expression can be simplified
to:<span class="math display">\[\mathcal{R}_{\textrm{Pal 5}}
=  \frac{1}{T} \sum_i \frac{1}{l (t_i)}.\]</span></p>
<p>This computation allowed us to analyze the distribution of gap
creation rates across all simulations. Notice that since the gap
creation rate adds in parallel, naturally, gaps that occur at earlier
times when the stream was shorter are weighted higher than those that
occur when the stream is longer. Fig. <a href="#fig:gapcreationrate"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:gapcreationrate">1</a>
presents these results which are is roughly consistent with a simple
estimate of the average gap creation rate: with 73 gaps over 5 Gyr of
integration time for a stream about 20 kpc in length, the naive estimate
is approximately 0.015 km s<span
class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> kpc<span
class="math inline">\(^{-2}\)</span> (which is roughly equivalent to
<span class="math inline">\(0.015~\rm{Gyr^{-1}kpc^{-1}}\)</span>). This
naive estimate is about double the weighted mean gap creation rate of
0.009 km s<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> kpc<span
class="math inline">\(^{-2}\)</span> and is higher because it does not
account for the growth of the stream over time, unlike Eq. <a
href="#eq:gap_creation_rate" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="eq:gap_creation_rate">[eq:gap_creation_rate]</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>Lastly, we note that of the 73 observed gaps, only eight are in the
trailing tail, and the rest are in the leading tail, which is a
surprising result. A priori, since the star particles escape at similar
rates from the L<span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> and L<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> Lagrange points, each tail is of
similar length and density. The main difference between the two tails is
that the leading tail is closer to the Galactic center than the trailing
tail by about 400 pc. Since the lengths are equal, and the offset
between the tails is slight compared to the Galactocentric distance of
about 10 kpc, we expected the gaps in each tail to be more or less the
same. We can compute the probability of observing the unequal
occurrences through the binomial distribution. First, since the 44 gaps
linked to NGC 2808 are the result of the same flyby, they are not
independent events. We remove them from this consideration, which leaves
21 gaps in the leading tail and 8 in the trailing. The probability of
observing up to 8 successes in 29 trials, given a 50% chance of success,
is 1.2%–unlikely, but possible. Additionally, other perturbers impact at
consistent times, which may violate the assumption of independent
events, as seen with NGC 2808.</p>
<h2 id="sect:geometry">Impact geometry and parameters of the
perturbers</h2>
<div class="figure*">
<p><img src="images/impact_geometry_statistics.png" alt="image" /></p>
</div>
<p>With the perturbers identified, we perform statistical analysis to
understand the conditions necessary for a globular cluster to induce a
gap in the Palomar 5 stream. We turn to impact theory, which in its
simplest form is presented in works such as <span class="citation"
data-cites="2008gady.book.....B">Binney and Tremaine (2008)</span>.
Consider two particles: one stationary and the other moving past it. The
impact parameter is the distance between the two particles at the point
of their closest approach. The impulse approximation is employed, which
assumes that the velocity of the perturber remains unchanged during the
interaction. This assumption simplifies the computation.</p>
<p>To understand how the impacted particle is perturbed, one needs to
compute its change in momentum, which is determined by integrating the
force acting on the particle throughout the interaction. A useful
approximation for this change in momentum, per unit mass, is the force
at the closest approach multiplied by an estimate of the interaction
time: <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:change_in_momentum} \Delta
p \approx \text{Force} \times \text{interaction time} = \frac{GM}{b^2}
\times 2\frac{b}{\delta v} = 2\frac{GM}{b \delta v},\]</span>where <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is the mass of the perturber, <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is the impact parameter, <span
class="math inline">\(\delta v\)</span> is the relative velocity of the
perturber with respect to the particle, and <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is the gravitational constant.</p>
<p>This equation asserts that a more massive perturber, passing closer
to the particle and moving more slowly, will have a greater impact. It
is important to note that the momentum change is inversely proportional
to the velocity of the perturber. Note that this contrasts with the
intuition from elastic collisions, such as those between billiard balls,
where higher velocities result in greater impacts.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="2015MNRAS.450.1136E">Erkal and
Belokurov (2015)</span> extended this impact theory from one point mass
impacting another to studying how an extended body impacts a stream by
quantifying the change in momentum of a given particle as a function of
its distance from the point of greatest impact along the stream. <span
class="citation" data-cites="2015MNRAS.450.1136E">Erkal and Belokurov
(2015)</span> models their perturber as a Plummer sphere, like in our
simulations. Since a stream is not a point but has length and an
orientation in space, one needs to consider the parallel and
perpendicular components of the velocity to describe the impact fully.
Consequently, five parameters determine the change in velocity of a
given stream particle: <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(r_p\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(W_\parallel\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(W_\perp\)</span>, which are the mass of the
perturber, size of the perturber, impact parameter, parallel and
perpendicular components of the relative velocity. As detailed in
Appendix <a href="#sec:reconstruction" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:reconstruction">[sec:reconstruction]</a>, we
calculated these parameters for all our <code>full</code> simulations by
selecting – for each of them – the strongest five flybys of a perturber
with the Palomar 5 stream. Thus, we compute 250 impacts and flag those
that give way to gaps.</p>
<p>Visual inspection of the five key impact parameters (<span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(r_p\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(W_\parallel\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(W_\perp\)</span>) did not reveal a clear
distinction between flybys that create gaps and those that do not.
Therefore, we only present the quantities from Eq. <a
href="#eq:change_in_momentum" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="eq:change_in_momentum">[eq:change_in_momentum]</a> in
Fig. <a href="#fig:impact_geometry_statistics" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:impact_geometry_statistics">[fig:impact_geometry_statistics]</a>.</p>
<p>Note that this figure displays the total relative velocity rather
than separating the parallel and perpendicular components, as no
specific trends were observed when plotting the two velocity components
separately. We also excluded the characteristic cluster radius, which
showed little correlation with the results, likely due to the narrow
range of globular cluster radii (see Fig. <a href="#fig:mass_size_plane"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:mass_size_plane">[fig:mass_size_plane]</a>). This
factor might be more significant for dark matter subhalos, where size
variation is greater.</p>
<p>While Fig. <a href="#fig:impact_geometry_statistics"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:impact_geometry_statistics">[fig:impact_geometry_statistics]</a>
demonstrates that mass, relative velocity, or impact parameter alone
cannot predict gap formation, one interesting result emerges: impact
parameters greater than 300 pc do not create gaps. The stream widths are
roughly 200 pc, as seen in the <a
href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15528089">online appendix</a>. This
finding is even more evident when examining the <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>-<span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>
plane. A series of perturbers at roughly <span
class="math inline">\(\sim8 \times 10^5 M_\odot\)</span> highlights
NGC 2808’s flybys, where all encounters with impact parameters under
200 pc result in gaps, while those beyond this distance do not. In other
words, even the most massive globular clusters with masses greater than
about <span class="math inline">\(10^6 M_\odot\)</span> cannot cause
gaps if their impact parameters are greater than roughly <span
class="math inline">\(300\)</span> pc. Interestingly, even fast
encounters (<span class="math inline">\(\delta v &gt; 300\)</span> km/s)
can produce gaps for impact parameter values below this threshold.
Perhaps this is not surprising, since the range of possible relative
velocities is much less than that of mass and impact parameters, which
vary by two and three orders of magnitude, respectively. In contrast,
the relative velocities only vary by about a factor of three.</p>

data-reference="eq:change_in_momentum">[eq:change_in_momentum]</a> and
calculate <span class="math inline">\(\Delta p\)</span>, the change in
momentum (per unit mass) imparted by a cluster flyby on Palomar 5
stream. Fig. <a href="#fig:deltap" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:deltap">2</a> shows the distribution of imparted
change in momentum for all impacts that produce a gap compared to those
that do not. On average, encounters that lead to gap creation impart a
change in momentum on stream particles, which is a factor of 10 higher
than encounters that do not form gaps (but with some overlap in the
low-velocity tail). Interestingly, changes in momentum, which lead to
gap creations, extend over a large range in velocities. There is a
factor of about 100 between the smallest and largest changes with
NGC 2808 (orange color in the histogram) imparting changes in the
velocity of stream particles, which redistribute over the whole range of
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta p\)</span>.</p>
<p>In addition to characterizing the parameters governing cluster
encounters with the stream, since we know which clusters have produced
gaps on the tail of Palomar 5, we can also verify their orbital and
structural properties. Fig <a href="#fig:mass_size_plane"

data-reference="fig:mass_size_plane">[fig:mass_size_plane]</a> shows
just this, where we first show the clusters’ mass and size (i.e.,
half-mass radius) that cause gaps on the tails of Palomar 5, dividing
them from those that do not. As can be seen, no cluster with mass below
<span class="math inline">\(10^5 M_\odot\)</span> causes gaps on the
Palomar 5 stream, and all perturbers, except FSR 1758, have a half-mass
radius below 10 pc. Even more interesting is their distribution in the
E-L<span class="math inline">\(_z\)</span> plane, which shows that the
clusters that cause gaps are on both direct and retrograde orbits
(negative and positive values of <span
class="math inline">\(L_z\)</span>). However, all of the perturbers
exist in an energy interval between <span
class="math inline">\(-2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(-1
\times10^5~\textrm{km}^2\textrm{s}^{-2}\)</span>, which is because only
clusters within Palomar 5’s orbital space can interact with the stream:
clusters with higher orbital energies tend to have larger apocenters
than that of Palomar 5 and thus spend most of their time away from
Palomar 5’s orbital volume.</p>
<p>Finally, it is worth noting the location of impacts with the stream,
specifically whether they occur when Palomar 5 is near its pericenter.
Fig. <a href="#fig:mass_size_plane" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:mass_size_plane">[fig:mass_size_plane]</a>’s bottom
panel shows that encounters can occur at all orbital phases of
Palomar 5, when it is close to the pericenter, but also very far away
from it, at the outskirts of its orbital space. However, when taken all
together, the location of gap-creating impacts shows a strong negative
correlation with the Galactocentric radius <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, with the number <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> of encounters favorable to gap
formation going as <span class="math inline">\(N = -2.5r + 50\)</span>
(with a Pearson coefficient of -0.86). While there are more clusters
near the Galactic center, clusters naturally spend more time near their
apocenters, and the lower relative velocities in these regions should
favor gap creation. However, this result suggests that the cluster
Galactic number density outweighs these factors when determining the
number of gaps. The results are for Palomar 5 only, and a future study
would need to investigate streams along various orbits before
generalizing this conclusion.</p>

<h2 id="self-segregation-and-stream-chilling">Self-Segregation and
Stream Chilling</h2>
<p>The classic collisionless boltzmann equation: <span
class="math display">\[\frac{df}{dt} = 0 = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}
\frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial v} \frac{dv}{dt}+
\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}\]</span></p>
<p>we are saying that the pusles drift with the same velocities thus
<span class="math inline">\(\frac{dv}{dt}=0\)</span>. I impart more
assumptions, namely that: <span
class="math inline">\(\rho(x,t=0)=\delta(x)\)</span> and that velocity
is defined as a normal distribution that does not change over time. This
means that I can write the initial distribution function as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(x,v,t=0) =
\delta(x)\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\textrm{exp}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{v-\langle
v \rangle}{\sigma}\right)^2\right)\]</span></p>
<p>the solution to the evolution of the density is <span
class="math inline">\(\rho = \int f dv\)</span>, and you also need to
perform this variable substitution <span class="math inline">\(f(x,v,t)
= f(x-vt,v,0)\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\rho(x,t) = \frac{1}{\sigma t
\sqrt{2\pi} }\textrm{exp}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\langle v
\rangle t}{\sigma_v t}\right)^2\right)\]</span></p>
<p>it’s also useful to know the relative velocity of the impact site
between one group and another. These things drift apart. How much faster
does one group go ahead of another? <span class="math display">\[\delta
v_{ij} = \frac{x\prime}{t-iT} - \frac{x\prime}{t-jT}\]</span> where
<span class="math inline">\(i,j\)</span> are the indexes for the packet.
Note that this only works for <span class="math inline">\(t &gt;
nT\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is the orbital
period, or spacing between the impacts, <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of pericenter passages.
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is the total simulation time.
<span class="math inline">\(x\prime\)</span> is the position of the
impact. It makes sense that the velocity of the particle is the position
where the impact occured, divided by the time since it left the
origin.</p>
