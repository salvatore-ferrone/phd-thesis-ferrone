<h1 id="methods"><strong><span>Numerical method</span></strong></h1>
<p>To model the formation and evolution of extra-tidal features around
Galactic globular clusters, we use a set of codes, called Globular
Clusters’ Tidal Tails (GCsTT) developed by our group. It comprises two
python codes, for the backward and forward integration of a stellar
system, made of N test-particles (see Sect. <a href="#numerical"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="numerical">2.1</a>). These
codes are separated for data organization and management, while the
(computationally) most expensive part, namely, the calculation of the
accelerations acting on the N particles and the orbits integration, is
realized by means of a Fortran module written by our group. This module
is interfaced to python by means of f2py directives from NumPy. The use
of test-particle methods for modeling the tidal stripping process is
widespread in the literature, where these methods are usually applied to
one or few clusters at a time <span class="citation"
data-cites="lane12 mastrobuono12 palau19 piatti21a grillmair22">(see,
e.g., <strong>lane12?</strong>; <strong>mastrobuono12?</strong>;
<strong>palau19?</strong>; <strong>piatti21a?</strong>;
<strong>grillmair22?</strong>)</span>. In this work, we apply a
test-particle methodology to the whole set (159) of Galactic globular
clusters for which this is currently possible, also taking into account,
for each cluster, the errors on astrometry, line-of-sight velocities<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and distances. In the following, we
describe the two main steps of the procedure used by GCsTT to simulate
the tidal stripping process (Sect. <a href="#numerical"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="numerical">2.1</a>), the
initial conditions adopted for the clusters’ parameters and their mass
distribution (Sect. <a href="#initialconds" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="initialconds">2.2</a>), as well as the Galactic
potentials (Sect. <a href="#galmod" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="galmod">2.3</a>).</p>
<h2 id="numerical">Simulations of the tidal stripping process: Two-step
procedure</h2>
<p>To model the formation and evolution of extra-tidal features around
Galactic globular clusters, and predict their current properties, we
proceed as follows:</p>
<p><em>Step i: Backward integration. Reconstructing the globular cluster
orbit over the last 5 Gyr</em>: First, for each Galactic globular
cluster for which the distances from the Sun, proper motions,
line-of-sight velocities, and structural parameters are available (see
Sect. <a href="#initialconds" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="initialconds">2.2</a>), we determine their current
positions and velocities in a Galactocentric reference frame, in which
the Sun is at <span class="math inline">\((x_\odot, y_\odot, z_\odot) =
(-8.34, 0., 0.027)\)</span> kpc <span class="citation"
data-cites="chen01 reid14">(<strong>chen01?</strong>;
<strong>reid14?</strong>)</span> and at a given velocity for the local
standard of rest, <span class="math inline">\(v_{LSR}= 240\)</span> km/s
<span class="citation"
data-cites="reid14">(<strong>reid14?</strong>)</span>, and a peculiar
velocity of the Sun with respect to the LSR, <span
class="math inline">\((U_{\odot}, V_{\odot}, W_{\odot})  = (11.1, 12.24,
7.25)\)</span> km/s <span class="citation"
data-cites="schonrich10">(<strong>schonrich10?</strong>)</span>. We then
integrate the orbit of a single point mass, representing the cluster
barycenter, backwards in time for 5 Gyr, and in this way, we retrieve
its position and velocity at that time in the chosen Galactic potential
(see Sect. <a href="#galmod" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="galmod">2.3</a>). We notice that other choices for the
Sun’s position or velocity with respect to the Galactocentric frame
would have been possible. For example, <span class="citation"
data-cites="piatti21a">(<strong>piatti21a?</strong>)</span> adopted the
same values as ours for the <span class="math inline">\(v_{LSR}\)</span>
and for the peculiar velocity of the Sun but with a different distance
to the Galactic center <span class="citation"
data-cites="gravity18">(8.1 kpc in their work, see
<strong>gravity18?</strong>)</span>. The difference in the adopted
position of the Sun is, however, generally smaller than the
uncertainties affecting our knowledge of the distance of Galactic
globular clusters to the Sun. For this reason, we do not to explore the
dependency of the results presented in this paper with regard to these
choices.</p>
<p><em>Step ii: Forward integration. Test-particle streams from the past
to the present day</em>: Once the positions and velocities of the
barycenter of each cluster, 5 Gyr ago, have been determined, we build
the corresponding <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>-body system,
with N = 100 000 particles. The phase-space coordinates of these
particles are generated following a Plummer distribution, with the total
mass and half-mass radius as described in Sect. <a href="#initialconds"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="initialconds">2.2</a>. The
barycenter of this <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>-body cluster
is then assigned initial positions and velocities in the Galactic model,
as those retrieved at step <span class="math inline">\((i),\)</span> and
the cluster is then integrated forward in time until the present day.
Particles in this <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>-body system are
modeled as test-particles, that is, they experience the gravitational
field exerted by the globular cluster itself (see Sect. <a
href="#initialconds" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="initialconds">2.2</a>) and by the Galaxy (see Sect. <a
href="#galmod" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="galmod">2.3</a>), but do not generate any gravitational
field themselves. This allows us to maintain a computational time which
scales as <span class="math inline">\(O(N)\)</span> and not as <span
class="math inline">\(O(N^2)\)</span>, as would be the case for a direct
<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>-body self-consistent
computation.</p>
<p>In the following, we refer to these simulations, made by using the
most probable values on distances, proper motions, and line-of-sight
velocities, as the “reference simulations.” In addition, for each
globular cluster, we also take into account the errors on its distance,
proper motions, and line-of-sight velocity, assuming Gaussian
distributions of the errors, treated independently, and by generating 50
random realizations of these parameters. For each of these realizations,
we repeat the steps described above, that is: (<em>step i</em>) we
determine the associated current positions and velocities in the chosen
Galactocentric reference frame, we integrate the orbit of the
single-point mass (representing the cluster barycenter) backwards in
time, retrieving the corresponding values 5 Gyr ago, (<em>step ii</em>)
we build an <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>-body cluster
containing <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>= 100 000 particles,
with total mass and half-mass radius as those used for the reference
simulation, and then we integrate the <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span>-body cluster forwards in time until the
present-day position.</p>
<p>To summarize, for a given Galactic potential, we run <span
class="math inline">\(159\times (50+1)=8109\)</span> simulations, where
159 is the total number of clusters for which we currently have both 6D
phase-space information and structural parameters. As we discuss in the
following section, the whole set of globular clusters has been evolved
in three different Galactic potentials, which implies that a total of 24
327 simulations have been run.</p>
<p>For the orbit integration, a leap-frog algorithm is used, with a
fixed time-step, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t\)</span>, and a
total number of steps, <span class="math inline">\(N_{steps}\)</span>,
such that the total simulated time is <span class="math inline">\(\Delta
t \times N_{steps}=5\)</span> Gyr. The choice of the value of <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta t\)</span> adopted to simulate each cluster
in the Galactic potential has been based on the energy conservation of
the corresponding cluster evolved in isolation (i.e., without the effect
of the Galactic gravitational field for 5 Gyr). For the majority of the
clusters (109/159), this value was set to <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta t = 10^5\)</span> yr (for a corresponding
value of <span class="math inline">\(N_{steps}=50\,000\)</span>), while
for the remaining clusters (50/159) a <span class="math inline">\(\Delta
t = 10^4\)</span> yr (for a corresponding value of <span
class="math inline">\(N_{steps}=500\,000\)</span>) was used. We refer to
Appendix <a href="#deltat" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="deltat">[deltat]</a> (and in particular to Table <a
href="#tcross-energy" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="tcross-energy">[tcross-energy]</a>) for additional
details on the choice of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t\)</span>
for the whole set of clusters. As for the total simulated time, while
globular clusters are much older than 5 Gyr, we chose this time limit
because the longer back in time we could go, the less certain we would
be of the Galactic environment. In addition, the last significant
mergers in the Galaxy happened between 9 and 11 Gyr ago <span

<p>Steps <span class="math inline">\((i)\)</span> and <span

same Plummer distribution used to generate the <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span>-body system is also used to calculate
the accelerations exerted on each particle as the system moves through
time. The Plummer sphere, representing the cluster potential, indeed
moves through the Galaxy along the orbit retrieved at step (i),
traveling this time in the opposite direction, from 5 Gyr ago to the
present day.</p>
<p>It might be noted that this implies that the globular cluster density
profile and its internal parameters (total mass and characteristic
radius) are constant over time in these models. This is, of course, a
crude approximation, because in reality both the internal parameters and
the density profile itself can change over time. We consider these
assumptions to be acceptable within the scope of our work given that we
are primarily interested in the distribution of extra-tidal stars, which
had once escaped from the cluster have dynamics primarily dictated by
the Galactic potential rather than the globular cluster itself. Of
course, the density of stars along the extra-tidal structures, as well
as the total mass lost, depend on these assumptions. That is to say that
if the mass of the cluster was not assumed constant over time, but could
possibly decrease, the gravitational attraction exerted by the cluster
itself on its stars would be weaker and this would lead to an increasing
mass loss and density along the tails. We could have proceeded with
diminishing the mass over time, based on some assumptions on the
temporal behavior of this relation, however, we did not find this
approach satisfying. In this way. we would have taken into account a
temporal evolution of the mass, but not of the size of the cluster,
adding a supplementary hypothesis to the problem. For these reasons, we
decided to maintain the simplest approach. We emphasize that other
groups have followed the same methodology, maintaining masses and sizes
that remain constant over time <span class="citation"

(abbreviated name: PI) consists of four components: two disks (thin and

<p>This model is a modification of the classical <span class="citation"
data-cites="allen91">(<strong>allen91?</strong>)</span> model, made to
include also the presence of a thick disk. As it has been discussed in
detail by <span class="citation"
data-cites="pouliasis17">(<strong>pouliasis17?</strong>)</span>, the
choice to include a massive spheroid in this model, as well as in the
original <span class="citation"
data-cites="allen91">(<strong>allen91?</strong>)</span> model, is
dictated by the need to reproduce CO/HI-based velocity curves, as those
provided by <span class="citation"
data-cites="sofue12">(<strong>sofue12?</strong>)</span>, which show a
rise and then a sudden decrease of the velocity curve in the inner
Galactic regions (<span class="math inline">\(R \le 2-3\)</span> kpc).
In an axisymmetric model, such a rise can be reproduced only if a
central spheroidal component, with a typical mass greater than 10% of
that of the disk(s), is added. However, as shown by <span
class="citation"
data-cites="chemin15">(<strong>chemin15?</strong>)</span>, the central
rise observed in the rotation of the molecular gas in the inner Galaxy
may be an effect of non-circular motions generated by large-scale
asymmetries such as the bar. Moreover, this feature is not reported in
all the observational studies <span class="citation"
data-cites="reid14">(see, e.g., <strong>reid14?</strong>, on which model
PII is based)</span>. In other words, if we do not assume that the mass
distribution of the inner Galaxy is axisymmetric, the need for a massive
spheroidal component to reproduce velocity curves, such as those from
<span class="citation"
data-cites="sofue12">(<strong>sofue12?</strong>)</span>, no longer
persists. In addition to that, in the last decade, a number of works
have shown that if a spheroidal bulge exists in the central regions of
our Galaxy, it has to be small <span class="citation"
data-cites="shen10 kunder12 dimatteo15 gomez18">(few percents of the

this model <span class="citation" data-cites="irrgang13">(as well as all
models including a massive central spheroid; see, e.g.,
<strong>irrgang13?</strong>)</span> with care when dealing with the
central parts of the Galaxy. Since models with a massive central
spheroid, however, are still used in the literature, we have included
model PI here, as a term of comparison.</p>

<p>Model II by <span class="citation"
data-cites="pouliasis17">(<strong>pouliasis17?</strong>)</span>
(abbreviated name: PII) consists of a spherical dark matter halo, with
the same functional form adopted in the <span class="citation"
data-cites="allen91">(<strong>allen91?</strong>)</span> model, and of
two disk components (a thin and a thick disk), with same functional form
as PI. This model does not include any central spheroid (i.e., it is a
bulge-less model) and thus its total potential is the sum of three
components only: <span class="math display">\[\Phi_{tot}(R, z) =
\Phi_{thin}(R, z) + \Phi_{thick}(R, z) + \Phi_{halo}(r),\]</span> with
the thin, thick disks, and dark matter halo having the same functional
forms adopted in PI.</p>
<p>As it has been shown in <span class="citation"
data-cites="pouliasis17">(<strong>pouliasis17?</strong>)</span>, this
model satisfies a number of observational constraints, such as the
stellar density at the solar vicinity, thin- and thick-disk scale
lengths and heights, the rotation curve as provided by <span
class="citation" data-cites="reid14">(<strong>reid14?</strong>)</span>
and the absolute value of the perpendicular force, <span
class="math inline">\(K_z\)</span>, as a function of distance to the
Galactic centre <span class="citation" data-cites="pouliasis17">(see
Sect. 2.5 in <strong>pouliasis17?</strong>)</span>. As it is, however,
an axisymmetric model, it fails to accurately describe the inner few kpc
of the Galaxy, where the stellar mass distribution has been shown to be
asymmetric.</p>
<h3 id="model-ii-with-a-massive-slowly-rotating-stellar-bar">Model II

<p>The third mass model (abbreviated name: PII-0.3-SLOW) that we use in
this paper is a version of PII by <span class="citation"
data-cites="pouliasis17">(<strong>pouliasis17?</strong>)</span> modified
to include a rotating stellar bar, whose mass has been assigned to be
30% of the (thin+thick) disk mass of PII. We assume that the bar rotates
with a constant pattern speed of <span
class="math inline">\(\Omega_{bar}=38\rm km~s^{-1}kpc^{-1}\)</span> and
that it is currently inclined of <span
class="math inline">\(25^\circ\)</span> with respect to the Sun-Galactic
center direction <span class="citation"
data-cites="blandhawthorn16">(see
<strong>blandhawthorn16?</strong>)</span>. We model it as a triaxial
distribution, whose gravitational potential is given by <span
class="citation" data-cites="long92">(<strong>long92?</strong>)</span>:
<span
class="math display">\[\Phi_{bar}(x,y,z)=\frac{GM_{bar}}{2a_{bar}}ln\left(
\frac{x-a_{bar}+T_{-}}{x+a_{bar}+T_{+}}   \right),\]</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(T_{\pm}=\left[ (a_{bar}\pm x)^2+ y^2 +  (b_{bar}+
\sqrt{c_{bar}^2+z^2})^2 \right]^{1/2}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(a_{bar}, b_{bar}, c_{bar}\)</span> the
characteristic bar parameters. The total gravitational potential
generated by this model thus takes the form: <span
class="math display">\[\Phi_{tot}(x, y, z) = \Phi_{thin}(R, z) +
\Phi_{thick}(R, z) + \Phi_{halo}(r)+  \Phi_{bar}(x, y, z).\]</span> with
all characteristic values given in Table <a href="#PII"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="PII">[PII]</a>. Practically,
to include the bar, we reduced the mass of the disks in such a way to
maintain the total stellar mass of this model as that of PII. <span
class="citation" data-cites="long92">(<strong>long92?</strong>)</span>
provide the formulas of the accelerations generated by this triaxial
distribution in the reference frame of the bar. To calculate and add
them to the accelerations generated by the disks and dark matter halo,
at each time step, we converted the positions of all particles in the
rotating, non-inertial reference frame of the bar, computed the
corresponding accelerations on each particle, and then transformed these
accelerations back in the inertial reference frame described in Sect. <a
href="#numerical" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="numerical">2.1</a>. In this way, the accelerations due
to the bar are added to those generated by the other terms of the
Galactic mass distribution.</p>
<p>We emphasize that we do not consider this model as the best possible
representation of the Galactic mass distribution, especially in the
central region. It can, however, provide a first indication on how the
inclusion of a rotating asymmetric component in the inner Galaxy can
affect the globular cluster streams, near and far from the Galactic
center.</p>
<p>Moreover, since the exact characteristics of the Milky Way bar are
still subject to debate <span class="citation"
data-cites="blandhawthorn16">(see, e.g.,
<strong>blandhawthorn16?</strong>)</span>, it is important to explore
how varying the parameters adopted in this paper, such as the pattern
speed, the mass, or the length of the bar, can affect the
characteristics of the whole set of streams. More complex shapes for the
bar can also be explored, for example, by substituting the inner parts
of the triaxial bar with a boxy-peanut-shaped morphology, which has been
shown to characterize the inner Milky Way <span class="citation"
data-cites="wegg13 wegg15">(see, e.g., <strong>wegg13?</strong>;
<strong>wegg15?</strong>)</span>. These topics are, however, beyond the
scope of the present paper. In sum, given the uncertainties on the bar’s
physical extent and how it can change over the time span investigated
here, its affect on the streams presented here are purely
indicative.</p>

<h4 id="a-few-basic-premises">A few basic premises:</h4>
<p>Given the large number of simulations carried out and the wealth of
information contained in them, it is not possible to exhaust all
possible applications of this simulation database in this paper. We have
therefore chosen to proceed as follows.</p>
<p>In Section <a href="#results1" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="results1">3.1</a>, we present an overview of the
distribution of all streams in Galactic coordinates. This coordinate
space will be the one used in the remainder of the entire article. This
first section allows us to show qualitatively how the global
distribution of streams varies, depending on the Galactic potential
used.</p>
<p>We then move on (Section <a href="#streamvsD"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="streamvsD">3.2</a>) to present
the global system of streams as a function of their distance from the
Sun. In this section, we also show the kinematic properties of the
streams, such as proper motions and line-of-sight velocities, that can
be directly compared to Gaia data or other astrometric and spectroscopic
surveys. This section also allows us to show the variety of morphologies
that the stars which escaped from globular clusters can take. In
Section <a href="#sec:morphologies" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:morphologies">[sec:morphologies]</a>, we explore
this issue in more detail, showing how these morphologies depend
primarily on the orbital characteristics of the clusters and their
distance from the Galactic center. For the most interesting cases, we
compare the tidal structures predicted by our simulations with streams
found in observational data. For this purpose, we make use of the
<em>galstreams</em> library of stellar streams in the Milky Way <span
class="citation"
data-cites="mateu22">(<strong>mateu22?</strong>)</span>, which
constitutes a unique and public database summarizing angular positions,
distances, proper motions, and line-of-sight velocity tracks for nearly
a hundred Galactic stellar streams. Any stream that is not included in
this library is not be compared to our simulations in the context of
this paper.</p>
<p>We note that the tidal features associated with each of the 159
simulated clusters are presented in Appendix <a href="#allstreams"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="allstreams">[allstreams]</a>.
To avoid making this appendix too long, the tidal features above are
presented only in the case of the potential PII. However, all the data
will be made available to the community at a dedicated site<a
href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> where it is possible to the way the
characteristics of these streams change, for any cluster, in the three
chosen potentials.</p>
<h2 id="results1">A sky full of streams</h2>
<p>Figure <a href="#galleryLB" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="galleryLB">[galleryLB]</a> shows the number and mass
density distributions of the whole set of simulated globular clusters
and their extra-tidal features in Galactic longitude and latitude for
the three Galactic potentials.</p>
<p>For all Galactic mass models adopted, a striking characteristic among
the plots in Figs. <a href="#galleryLB" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="galleryLB">[galleryLB]</a> is the variety of features
that our models predict, which are reminiscent of the tidal tails,
stellar streams, and shells that are produced by interacting and merging
galaxies in the process of mass assembly <span class="citation"
data-cites="mancillas19">(see, e.g.,
<strong>mancillas19?</strong>)</span>. Some clusters have very thin and
elongated streams, which describe arcs that can extend up to <span
class="math inline">\(180^\circ\)</span> in longitude, or tens of kpc in
physical space. In some other cases, extra-tidal features appear shorter
(a few up to ten degrees) and sometimes also thicker (about <span
class="math inline">\(10^\circ\)</span> in the sky) than others.
Finally, in some cases, clusters are surrounded by extended structures,
such as halos, rather than coherent and thin streams.</p>
<p>This variety of properties depends on several factors: the distance
of the stream to the Sun (due to projection; i.e., for a given physical
thickness, the closer the stream is to the Sun, the more extended it
appears in the <span class="math inline">\((\ell, b)\)</span> plane),
its orbital phase (towards the peri-center or the apo-center of the
orbit), and the orbital properties of the parent globular cluster. We
also see from these figures that stellar particles stripped from their
parent clusters do not only redistribute in coherent structures, but in
some cases, they can also contribute to a more diffuse density
distribution.</p>
<p>Because of the large number of simulated clusters, we have chosen not
to present the corresponding extra-tidal features one-by-one in the main
part of this paper, but we have rather decided to describe these
extra-tidal features with a global approach, by first adopting a
criterion based on the distance of these features to the Sun (see
Sect. <a href="#streamvsD" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="streamvsD">3.2</a>) and then discussing the types of
distributions tidal debris can have and how these depend on the cluster
orbital parameters (see Sect. <a href="#sec:morphologies"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:morphologies">[sec:morphologies]</a>). All the
extra-tidal structures generated by the 159 globular clusters simulated
in this paper, and their corresponding uncertainties, are reported in
Appendix <a href="#allstreams" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="allstreams">[allstreams]</a>. Among them, we include
clusters with thin and elongated tails, such as IC 4499, NGC 3201,
NGC 4590, NGC 5024, NGC 5053, Pal 5, to cite a few, as well as clusters
such as AM 1, Pal 14, Pal 4, and Pal 15, whose extra-tidal material
shows a halo-like configuration, and clusters such as NGC 1261,
NGC 4147, NGC 6356, and UKS 1, whose stripped stars show a remarkable
diffuse distribution in the field.</p>
<p>Finally, even when our models are not tailored to accurately
reproduce the mass loss from globular clusters, since (as described in
Sect. <a href="#initialconds" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="initialconds">2.2</a>) we have adopted a test-particle
approach with a time-constant globular cluster potential, it is however
tempting to estimate, to a first order, the total mass associated with
the tidally stripped population and compare it to the current mass. By
calculating the mass lost in the field in the past 5 Gyr as the sum of
the mass of all particles<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> that have escaped the cluster (<span
class="math inline">\(t_{\rm esc}&gt; 0\)</span>), we find that the PI
model sheds <span class="math inline">\(2.1\times 10^{7}
M_{\odot}\)</span>, which is 55% of the GC population’s current mass.
The PII model shed is <span class="math inline">\(2.7\times 10^{6}
M_{\odot}\)</span>, which is 7% of the current mass. Similarly, the
PII-0.3-SLOW model lost <span class="math inline">\(3.7\times 10^{6}
M_{\odot}\)</span>, which is 10% of the current mass and gives a half
mass radius of 6.3 kpc.</p>
<p>This mass roughly constitutes one-hundredth to one-tenth of the total
stellar halo mass <span class="citation"
data-cites="blandhawthorn16">(<strong>blandhawthorn16?</strong>)</span>
and it is probably only a lower limit on the mass of escaped stars in
the field, since a number of clusters initially in the Galaxy must have
been destroyed over time (see introduction) and are thus no longer
identifiabl as globular clusters today. It is also interesting to note
that escaped stars are mostly redistributed in the inner Galaxy, with
the half-mass radius of the PI model being 4.0 kpc and that of the PII
and PII-0.3-SLOW models being 6.3 kpc.</p>
<p>The total mass lost from the clusters, as well as its spatial
distribution, thus depends on the Galactic potential adopted: the
variations between the PI model and both the PII and PII-0.3-SLOW models
are of course caused by the PI’s inclusion of the bulge, which leads to
larger tidal forces in the center of the galaxy and subsequently drives
larger mass loss.</p>
<p>Despite the differences in the modeling approach, it is interesting
to compare our results to those of <span class="citation"
data-cites="baumgardt2017global">(<strong>baumgardt2017global?</strong>)</span>.
Briefly, our experiments differ in the following ways: they employ
N-body simulations while we use our test-particle approach; they have an
integration time of 12 Gyrs compared to our 5 Gyrs; lastly, their
clusters have circular orbits in a Galactic potential modeled as an
isothermal sphere as compared to the more realistic orbits and Galactic
potentials considered in this work. Interestingly, the authors find that
over 12 Gyrs their population of globular clusters lose two-thirds of
their initial mass. This is roughly consistent with our application of
the PI model, whose globular clusters shed 35% of their initial mass in
5 Gyrs, which is roughly half the mass found by <span class="citation"
data-cites="baumgardt2017global">(<strong>baumgardt2017global?</strong>)</span>
in a period that is also about half as long.</p>
