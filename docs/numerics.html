<h1 id="sec:Computer">The computer is a tool</h1>
<p>Not too long ago, I took a course where one of the professors made a
rather blunt observation: “You’re bad at math, <em>really bad at
math</em>." Surprisingly, this comment was not meant to be a targeted
insult to our self-esteem, as he included himself in this comment, but
rather a generational observation. He was comparing physicists born
before and after approximately 1980, drawing a distinction between those
who grew up with computers and those who did not. He went on to say,
“There’s just something different about those who couldn’t look
solutions up online and had no access to Wolfram Alpha; you can see it
in the way they carry themselves."</p>
<p>I’ve spent a lot of time reflecting on his words, and I’ve come to
see the truth in them. While I may sometimes romanticize the idea of
being so sharp that I could effortlessly use Bessel functions of the
first kind to solve partial differential equations right after
breakfast, I also appreciate the skill set we’ve gained in exchange:
<em>programming</em>. The computer has proven to be a remarkably
powerful tool, and it has fundamentally changed the way we approach
problem-solving.</p>
<p>When I embarked on this thesis, my primary tools were Python,
utilizing libraries like Numpy for data manipulation and Matplotlib for
plotting. However, as the scope of my work expanded to writing code for
numerical simulations, I found myself diving headfirst into the world of
Fortran. At the same time, this transition also involved mastering SSH
connections to remote machines, writing code with task parallelization,
submitting jobs to supercomputers, and efficiently managing a complex
code project using Git. Additionally, I had to navigate the challenges
of handling and processing hundreds of gigabytes of data.</p>
<p>At the outset of my thesis, a crucial question I pondered was
<em>how</em> to perform the orbital computations necessary for my
research. Initially, our published work in <span class="citation"
data-cites="2023A&amp;A...673A..44F">Ferrone et al. (2023)</span> relied
on a custom Fortran script that we had developed. However, as our
project evolved and our ambitions grew to include more complex physics,
we recognized the need for a substantial overhaul of the code. I was
well aware of the common programming pitfall of reinventing the wheel
when existing solutions are available. To explore alternative options, I
delved into the Python package known as <code>Galpy</code> <span
class="citation" data-cites="2015ApJS..216...29B">(Bovy 2015)</span>,
which offers a range of useful functions for computing orbits within a
Galactic context.</p>
<p>While <code>Galpy</code> had its merits, it lacked the flexibility
required for accommodating the time-varying potentials we needed in our
simulations. As a result, I embarked on a journey to develop my own
extensive code, tailored to the specific demands of my research.</p>
<p>While this code is not yet fully prepared for public release, it can
be accessed at <a href="https://gitlab.obspm.fr/sferrone/gc-tidal-loss"
class="uri">https://gitlab.obspm.fr/sferrone/gc-tidal-loss</a>. The code
is a hybrid of Python and Fortran. Fortran is utilized for orbital
computations, whereas Python is employed for data management and
analysis. The subsequent three sections provide detailed insights into
the code: integration units are explained in Section <a
href="#sec:integrationUnits" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:integrationUnits">1.1</a>, a concise code
walk-through is presented in Section <a
href="#sec:MinimumWorkingExample" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:MinimumWorkingExample">1.2</a>, and the handling of
uncertainties is discussed in Section <a href="#sec:uncertainties"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:uncertainties">1.3</a>.</p>
<h2 id="sec:integrationUnits">Integration units</h2>
<p>In astronomy, we employ a distinct set of units that defies the
conventions of the International System of Units (SI). This deviation is
warranted due to the vast cosmic distances, time scales spanning the age
of the universe, and the immense masses of celestial objects, rendering
the use of meters, seconds, and kilograms impractical and unintuitive.
Furthermore, from a computational perspective, it is advantageous to
work with unit values that are close to unity rather than dealing with
quantities that span several orders of magnitude, as this can help
reduce round-off errors.</p>
<p>In our astronomical system of units, we rely on three fundamental
dimensions: mass, time, and length. But in fact we will choose length,
<em>velocity</em>, and mass to be the fundamental units and let the
time, acceleration, and gravitational constant be derived: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    L &amp;= 1 \mathrm{kpc},&amp;
V&amp;=1\mathrm{km/s},&amp;M=1\mathrm{M}_{\odot}.
\end{aligned}\]</span> These choices offer several advantages. First,
the distance from the sun to the center of the galaxy is approximately 8
kiloparsecs (kpc), making the kiloparsec a natural unit for astronomical
distances. Line-of-sight velocities are typically measured in kilometers
per second (km/s), and the typical speed of stars in the galaxy is on
the order of 200 km/s. Using a solar mass as the unit for mass allows
for a quick estimate of the number of stars in a system. For instance,
galaxies have masses between <span
class="math inline">\(10^{10}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(10^{12}\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{M}{\odot}\)</span>, while globular
clusters have masses between <span class="math inline">\(10^{4}\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(10^{6}\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{M}{\odot}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this choice of units will naturally constrain the other
units in our system. When converting from SI units, the gravitational
constant becomes: <span class="math display">\[G = 4.3009 \times 10^{-6}
\left(\frac{\mathrm{km}}{\mathrm{s}}\right)^2 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}^{-1}
\mathrm{kpc}.\]</span> A great way to remember the new units of the
gravitational constant is to first recognize that gravitational
potential has units of velocity squared, and subsequently imagine the
the Keplerian potential: <span class="math inline">\(\Phi =
G\frac{M}{r}\)</span>. Thus, the gravitational constants requires
inverse mass and distance to result in velocity squared. Next, the unit
of time of time in our system becomes: <span class="math display">\[t =
\frac{l}{v} = 1  \frac{\mathrm{kpc}}{\mathrm{km}}\mathrm{s}.\]</span>
This unit may seem unconventional, but it has a numerical value of
approximately 0.98 billion years (Gyr), making the integration units
slightly smaller than a billion years. A useful mnemonic to remember
this unit derivation is that 1 kilometer per second (km/s) is roughly
equivalent to 1 kiloparsec per gigayear (kpc/Gyr). With this
understanding, we can quickly estimate the duration of a "galactic
year." Given that the Sun has a circular velocity of about 220 km/s at a
radial distance of approximately 8 kpc from the Galactic center, it
takes approximately 0.22 Gyr or 220 million years to complete one
orbit.</p>
<p>Regarding the unit of acceleration, we can derive it from the
relation <span class="math inline">\(g = -\nabla \Phi\)</span>, which
represents a change in velocity squared per unit length: <span
class="math inline">\(\left(\frac{\mathrm{km}}{\mathrm{s}}\right)^2
\mathrm{kpc}^{-1}\)</span>. When multiplied by a unit of time, we once
again obtain a unit of velocity. This definition aligns with the concept
of acceleration as the time derivative of velocity, where dividing the
unit of velocity by the unit of time yields units consistent with the
gradient of the potential.</p>
<h2 id="sec:MinimumWorkingExample">Minimum example</h2>
<p>Here, in order to explain the mechanics of the code I wrote for my
thesis, I provide a minimum example. Originally, I began writing a
minimum <em>working</em> example, however, it became to cluttered for a
small first year report. A minimum working example already exists can be
provided upon request.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="host-integration">Host integration</h3>
<p>Assuming that you are working in a Jupyter notebook and have already
imported the necessary modules and loaded the required data, the initial
step for using this numerical integrator is to provide the parameters
for the Galaxy:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" data-language="python"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>integrator.setstaticgalaxy(MWgravfield[<span class="dv">0</span>],MWgravfield[<span class="dv">1</span>])</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first argument, <code>MWgravfield[0]</code>, specifies the name
of the potential, which tells the code which subroutine to use.
Typically, “pouliasis2017pii" is used. The next argument,
<code>MWgravfield[1]</code>, is a Python list of floating-point numbers
representing the parameters of the various components of the potential.
These parameters include the masses and scale lengths. The order and
number of parameters must match the potential you’re using. For example,
“pouliasis2017pii" expects 11 parameters, including the gravitational
constant, four halo parameters, and three disc parameters for thin and
thick discs.</p>
<p>After specifying the potential, you need to provide the initial
positions and velocities of the particles you want to integrate. Each of
the arrays passed should have a length of <code>N</code>, where
<code>N</code> is the number of particles you intend to integrate:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" data-language="python"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>integrator.setinitialkinematics(</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>        GCcoord.x.value,GCcoord.y.value,GCcoord.z.value,</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>        GCcoord.v_x.value,GCcoord.v_y.value,GCcoord.v_z.value)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This code snippet provides the positions and kinematics of all
globular cluster coordinates. The <code>.value</code> is included at the
end of each variable because they are Astropy Quantities that include
both numbers and units. Using <code>.value</code> returns the
floating-point number without the unit. Passing an
<code>Astropy.Quantity</code> instance to the Fortran module would
result in an error. Finally, you can set the integration parameters of
the system:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3" data-language="python"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>integrator.setintegrationparameters(T.value,dt.value,NSTEP)  </span></code></pre></div>
<p>The previous steps can be understood as initialization. With all the
information in place, now the positions and the velocities can be
integrated:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4" data-language="python"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>xt,yt,zt,vxt,vyt,vzt<span class="op">=</span>integrator.leapfrogintime(</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>        integrator.ntimesteps,</span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>        integrator.nparticles)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Notice that the number of time steps and particles must be passed as
arguments to this subroutine. This may seem redundant since the number
of particles, <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, is known from the
<code>setinitialkinematics</code>, and the number of time steps was
established in the previous step. However, since the values are not
known at compilation time for the subroutine, they need to be passed at
runtime. The orbits of each globular cluster over the course of 1
billion years are shown in Fig. <a href="#fig:all-orbits"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:all-orbits">[fig:all-orbits]</a>.</p>
<p><img src="images/allorbits-example.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="images/example-integration.png" alt="image" /></p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="particle-integration">Particle
integration</h3>
<p>After the orbit of the host is obtained, a very similar procedure is
followed to create the streams. I.e. first the system must be
initialized and then the integration call is made. There are two main
differences. The first is that we must now generate the initial
positions of the star-particles within a globular cluster. I wrote a
code to create the initial conditions as discussed in section <a
href="#sec:DistributionFunctionSampling" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:DistributionFunctionSampling">[sec:DistributionFunctionSampling]</a>.</p>
<pre><code>    xp,yp,zp,vxp,vyp,vzp=particleDistributions.isotropicplummer(
        G.value,mass.value,halfmassradius.value,NP) </code></pre>
<p>Now we shift these positions and velocities to about the globular
cluster of interest, which is identified with a
<code>GCindex</code>.</p>
<pre><code>    xi=xp+GCcoord.x.value[GCindex]
    yi=yp+GCcoord.y.value[GCindex]
    zi=zp+GCcoord.z.value[GCindex]
    vxi=vxp+GCcoord.v_x.value[GCindex]
    vyi=vyp+GCcoord.v_y.value[GCindex]
    vzi=vzp+GCcoord.v_z.value[GCindex]</code></pre>
<p>Now the initial positions and integration parameters are established,
just as before:</p>
<pre><code>    integrator.setstaticgalaxy(MWgravfield[0],MWgravfield[1])
    integrator.setintegrationparameters(T.value,dt.value,NSTEP)
    integrator.setinitialkinematics(xi,yi,zi,vxi,vyi,vzi)</code></pre>
<p>Here is the second main difference, which is that the positions and
velocities of the host must also be passed:</p>
<pre><code>    thost=np.linspace(0,T.value,NSTEP+1)
    integrator.inithostperturber(
        thost,
        xt[GCindex,0:NSTEP+1],
        yt[GCindex,0:NSTEP+1],
        zt[GCindex,0:NSTEP+1],
        vxt[GCindex,0:NSTEP+1],
        vyt[GCindex,0:NSTEP+1],
        vzt[GCindex,0:NSTEP+1],
        mass.value,
        characteristicradius.value)    </code></pre>
<p>During the computation, the Fortran module will evaluate the current
time of the system, determine the position of the host, and compute its
force on all of the particles specified in the initial conditions. You
might wonder why velocities are passed, given that the gravitational
force only requires the position. The reason is that during the
integration, we evaluate the energy of each particle relative to the
center of mass to determine whether the particle is bound or unbound.
Therefore, we must know the host’s velocity to calculate the kinetic
energy of each star particle. Finally, the integration of the particles
is executed using the following command:</p>
<pre><code>    integrator.leapfrogtofinalpositions()</code></pre>
<p>This subroutine integrates the positions of the particles to the end.
In this subroutine, we do not need to pass the number of steps nor the
number of particles since we are not saving the intermediate positions.
Therefore, we do not need to allocate arrays at run-time, unlike the
previous <code>leapfrogintime</code> subroutine. The output of this
example is shown in the right panels of Fig. <a href="#fig:all-orbits"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:all-orbits">[fig:all-orbits]</a>, where the orbit of
the globular cluster of interest, Palomar 5, is shown in blue. The
initial configuration of the Plummer system is depicted with the green
dots. Each particle is integrated for 1 Gyr, all the while experiencing
the gravitational forces from both the galaxy and the Plummer sphere
representing the host. This provides the output shown with the red
dots</p>
<h2 id="sec:uncertainties">Uncertainties</h2>
<p>There are different types of uncertainty affecting this project: (1)
observational uncertainties, (2) modelling uncertainty, and (3)
numerical uncertainty. I will briefly discuss each one here, although
the final draft of the thesis will include a much more rich
discussion.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="observational-uncertainty">Observational
uncertainty</h3>
<p>Regarding the observational uncertainty, most of the quantities
reported in <span class="citation"
data-cites="2021yCat..74781520B">Baumgardt and Hilker (2021)</span> are
accompanied with errors. We approximate the uncertainties as <span
class="math inline">\(1\sigma\)</span> Gaussian errors. The kinematic
properties of the clusters are reported in right ascension (RA),
declination (DEC), solar distance <span
class="math inline">\(R_{\mathrm{sun}}\)</span>, proper motions in RA
&amp; DEC, as well as line-of-sight velocities. Uncertainties are
included on all of the above save for RA and DEC, since their
uncertainties are negligible compared to the others. Additionally, the
uncertainties in the proper motions are correlated, which consider.
Regarding the internal dynamics, the dataset includes a rich set of
parameters such as velocity anisotropy, and core-density concentration.
We do not consider these values since we are using a simplified Plummer
sphere. The limitations due to these simplifications are discussed next.
From the database, we extract the half-mass radii of the clusters as
well as the mass–which contain uncertainties that we consider. In all,
for each globular cluster, we create 50 sets of initial conditions. One
set of initial conditions contains a realization of the kinematic
parameters and a distribution of 100,000 particles. Thus, the possible
the uncertainties in the position and kinematics drive the orbital
uncertainty while the mass of the cluster drives the uncertainty in the
internal dynamics. Examples of different orbits based on the sampling of
the initial conditions for pairs of phase space coordinates for three
globular clusters is presented in Fig. <a
href="#fig:orbit-uncertainties" data-reference-type="ref"

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="modelling-uncertainties">Modelling
uncertainties</h3>
<p>All models are wrong. Therefore, as a numerical modeler, it’s
critical to ask questions such as, ‘How accurate is my model? What
specific inquiries can my model address? And conversely, what questions
is it incapable of answering?’ It’s imperative to recognize and
acknowledge the limitations of your model.</p>
<p>In this experiment, there are primarily two significant sources of
modeling uncertainties. The first pertains to how we represent the
gravitational field of the Milky Way, while the second concerns the
internal dynamics of the globular clusters.</p>
<p>Numerous gravitational models for the Milky Way exist. In our study,
we focused on three specific models. The first two models, as documented
in <span class="citation"
data-cites="2017A&amp;A...598A..66P">(Pouliasis, Di Matteo, and Haywood
2017)</span>, were considered, and we also explored a modified version
of a model therein, which incorporates a rotating stellar bar. It’s
worth noting that our research aims to explore additional models to
determine which ones yield stellar streams that best replicate
observations.</p>
<p>Another modeling decision we made concerns the duration for which we
integrated the orbits of the globular clusters, which we set at 5 Gyr.
This timespan is sufficiently long to induce a notable amount of tidal
loss from the globular clusters. Equally important, this period is a
safe choice, considering that the Milky Way can be assumed to be in
relatively stable equilibrium. To illustrate, the last significant
merger event that had a substantial impact on the Milky Way’s mass and
equilibrium, involving the disintegration of a satellite—likely
Sagittarius—occurred over 5 Gyr ago <span class="citation"
data-cites="2020MNRAS.498.2472K">(Kruijssen et al. 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the internal dynamics of the globular clusters play a
crucial role in determining both the rate and the specific stars that
are ejected over time. Globular clusters present a unique challenge due
to their two-body relaxation time comparable to the typical age of
globular clusters, approximately 10 Gyr. An intriguing phenomenon
resulting from the collisions between stars within globular clusters is
known as "mass segregation." This phenomenon leads to more massive stars
tending to migrate toward the cluster’s center, while less massive stars
are pushed toward the outskirts.</p>
<p>The study conducted by <span class="citation"
data-cites="2018MNRAS.474.2479B">Balbinot and Gieles (2018)</span>
underscored the importance of mass segregation in understanding stellar
streams and revealed some seemingly counterintuitive outcomes. For
instance, if the mass of a globular cluster increases, one might expect
its tidal tails to be brighter due to a higher number of potentially
escaped stars. However, mass segregation causes more low-mass stars to
escape, which are dimmer, resulting in difficult-to-observe tails.</p>
<p>Properly addressing the internal dynamics of globular clusters is
indeed a computationally expensive task. In our current treatment, we
adopt an <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}(n)\)</span> computation
time, focusing on integrating particles influenced by a gravitational
field only. A higher-order approach would involve considering N-body
interactions, which would have a computational complexity of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}(n^2)\)</span>. However, even this
doesn’t constitute the most accurate description of the dynamics. To
achieve a more precise representation, one would need to account for the
mass distribution of stars within the cluster and establish an initial
configuration, potentially following a distribution like the Kroupa mass
function <span class="citation" data-cites="2001MNRAS.322..231K">(Kroupa
2001)</span>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the presence of binary star systems poses a challenge.
Accounting for binary stars would significantly reduce the code’s
computational speed because the dynamical timescale for binary star
systems is on the order of a few years. This reduction in integration
time-step could exceed four orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>Additionally, the issue of stellar remnants and black holes within
the centers of globular clusters is worth considering. We’re not
suggesting that Newtonian mechanics must be abandoned in favor of
general relativity due to black holes in the cluster. However, it’s
important to acknowledge that the presence of a very massive object at
the system’s center can significantly impact the dynamics, as has been
observed <span class="citation" data-cites="2023MNRAS.522.5740V">(Vitral
et al. 2023)</span>.</p>
<p>The primary objective of this thesis is to gain insights into the
distribution of tidal debris emanating from the entire globular cluster
system. As a result, we must make certain simplifications that enable us
to make predictions for all approximately 150 globular clusters. This
involves Monte Carlo sampling of orbital uncertainties and exploring
various galactic potential models. Given the scope of our work, a
comprehensive exploration of the internal dynamics to a high degree of
precision is currently unfeasible for the entire system. Nevertheless,
we may delve into this aspect on a per-cluster basis in the future if
higher resolution is deemed necessary.</p>
<p>We find our approach acceptable for several reasons. First, once
particles escape from the globular cluster, their motion is largely
governed by the Milky Way’s gravitational field. Our primary concern is
ensuring the rate at which particles escape from the clusters in our
models aligns with reality. Since the primary drivers of mass loss are
tidal forces and the three-body problem, we are confident in the results
our models yield. Furthermore, <span class="citation"
data-cites="2012A&amp;A...546L...7M">Mastrobuono-Battisti et al.
(2012)</span> has demonstrated that there is hardly a difference in the
morphology of tidal tails when comparing N-body simulations to
test-particle simulations.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="numerical-uncertainty">Numerical
uncertainty</h3>
<p>The numerical accuracy of the orbital solutions is a crucial
consideration, as numerical errors can introduce artificial acceleration
to particles, potentially leading to an inflated mass loss rate.
Numerical uncertainties are primarily influenced by the size of the
integration time-step and the chosen numerical method. In our approach,
we utilize a leap-frog integration scheme.</p>
<p>To determine an appropriate time-step for each system, we first
integrated the star-particles within each globular clusters in isolation
for 1 Gyr, employing an initial time-step of <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta t = 10^5~\mathrm{yr}\)</span>. During this
integration, we calculated the mean energy conservation relative to the
initial energy of the system, denoted as <span
class="math inline">\(\langle\delta E\rangle/E_0\)</span>. For
approximately two-thirds of the clusters, a typical energy drift smaller
than <span class="math inline">\(10^{-10}\)</span> was observed.
However, the remaining clusters required higher resolution.
Consequently, we reduced the time-step to <span
class="math inline">\(10^4~\mathrm{yr},\)</span> ensuring that the
energy drift rate remained below <span
class="math inline">\(10^{-10}\)</span> for all clusters.</p>
<p>In the current version of the code, we have refined the method for
evaluating numerical uncertainties. A detailed analysis of this process
will be presented in the accompanying published article on our methods.
In summary, we expanded our investigation to assess the effects of
temporal resolution on the orbits of globular clusters. Given that the
dynamical time of a globular cluster within the Galaxy is significantly
shorter than the dynamical time of a particle within the cluster,
there’s no need for an ultra-short time-step to ensure energy
conservation. However, we adjusted the time-step to guarantee that the
drift in the final positions of the globular clusters after 5 Gyr is
significantly smaller than their characteristic sizes.</p>
