<h1 class="title">Numerics</h1>
</header>
<p>In line with a thesis in computational astrophysics, the equations of
motion presented here do not admit closed-form analytical solutions. As
such, we must rely on numerical methods and computer simulations to
solve them. Specifically, I solve <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>
independent sets of Hamilton’s equations, each consisting of six
first-order, coupled differential equations.</p>
<p>Numerical integration presents several challenges. First, there is
the practical question: how do we actually solve these equations? Most
students first encounter a simple update scheme, such as Euler’s method:
<span class="math inline">\(y_{i+1} = y_i + \frac{dy}{dt}\Delta
t\)</span>. However, this quickly becomes insufficient for coupled
systems or for problems where precision and conservation laws are
essential. How can we be confident that our numerical solutions
faithfully approximate the true dynamics, especially when the true
solution is unknown? How do we handle performance, data volume, or the
trade-offs between speed and accuracy?</p>
<p>Although many software packages already exist to solve such problems,
I chose to write my own code. Some senior researchers warn, “Don’t
reinvent the wheel.” Others lamet that “the problem with the youth today
is that no one knows how the packages they use work.” Caught between
damned if I do and damned if I don’t, I decided to write my own solver
anyway. This led to the development of <code>tstrippy</code>, a code
designed to solve the restricted three-body problem. My motivation was
part practical: I wanted to avoid installation headaches, steep learning
curves, and uncertainty over whether existing tools could handle my
specific setup. But above all else, I wanted to create a reliable
product that works, allows me to reproduce my results, and run my
simulations at scale.</p>
<p>Developing my own package gave me a deeper understanding of code
structure, numerical algorithms, and the subtleties of scientific
programming. It also gave me the confidence to later use other packages
more effectively. The <code>tstrippy</code> code is available on GitHub
and runs on macOS and Linux.</p>
<p>This chapter documents how I numerically solve the equations of
motion, how I validate the accuracy of the solutions, and how the code
is organized under the hood.</p>
<h1 id="astronomical-units-and-scaling">Astronomical units and
scaling</h1>
<p>When writing any code, the choice of units is important. Astronomical
units are rarely the same as SI units. In general, the choice of units
is observationally and historically motivated, which results in a system
that uses multiple units for the same quantity, which can be confusing
at first. To start, since we are observing the sky, everything is
reported in spherical coordinates. Positions on the sky are reported in
degrees, or for the right ascension, the equivalent of longitude, even
in hour angle. Distances to the Earth are reported in parsecs since they
are derived from measuring the parallax angle (if they are derived from
the parallax angle and not other methods). Line-of-sight velocities are
reported in kilometers per second, as they are determined through
spectroscopy to measure the relativistic Doppler effect. Then, the
proper motions are reported based on the hour angle, which is the change
in a given star’s position on the celestial sphere from one year to the
next, which is millarcseconds per year. So far, we have three units for
angular position, none of which are the SI’s radians. We use kilometers
and parsecs for distance, and years and seconds are units of time. How
do we resolve this mess? For example, what would the unit of
acceleration be? km/s^2? parsec/year/second?</p>
<p>Units are a solved problem and are best presented through the
Buckingham PI theorem. When considering issues of ordinary mechanics, we
can choose a set of basis vectors that are distance, time, and mass. All
other quantities are expressed as a linear combination of their
exponents: [units] = <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{l}^a\times
t^b\times m^c = \begin{bmatrix} a\\b\\c \end{bmatrix}\)</span>. Velocity
is [1,-1,0], momentum is [1,-1,1], and acceleration is [1,-2,0].</p>
<p>Note that there are no fundamental dimensions; we can describe any
quantity as long as we span and that all basis vectors are linearly
independent. In stellar dynamics, distance, time, and often not chosen
as the basis vectors. I choose the basis vectors as distance, velocity,
and mass, with units of kpc, km/s, and solar masses, respectively. As a
result, time is a unit [1,-1,0], which is s kpc/km. As a consequence,
time is not an “intuitive” unit, like years. However, the universe
helped us out in that 1 kpc / Gyr <span
class="math inline">\(\approx\)</span> 1 km /s.</p>

<p><span class="citation" data-cites="2018ComAC...5....2V">Varri et al.
(2018)</span> talks about a series of papers between a larger
collaboration of people who specialize in collisional dynamics and who
have performed a series of workshops together. The introduction stated
that the collaboration wants to tackle many open questions regarding
stellar clusters and build the necessary codes to interprete the future
large quantity of data that was destined to come. It has now come since
the review was 2018. An interesting point was that in general globular
clusters are approximated as being orderless, i.e. isotropic but order
does present itself within these stelalr systems. Another large problem
is no one knows what a good set of initial conditiosn is. Unresolved
binaries pose a problem because you can overestiamte the total mass of
the system. If I talk about this review, I should probably discuss some
of the results from the papers that is builds on or at least their
techinques.</p>
<p>The MODEST review led me to discover AMUSE, which is an framework for
integrating various astrophysical codes for solving 4 types of problems:
gravitational dynamics, radiative transfer, hydrodynamics, and stellar
evolution. The codes are written by the community and are interfaced
together with Amuse. The user end is python. I have spent some time
reading the book, which is instructive and well written. Steve McMillian
is one of the authors. The code has a large support on GitHub and is
still being developped. I have had trouble trying to install the code.
It seems as though their documentation is incoherrent. At one place, it
said ‘pip’ is the easiest way to install. It didn’t work. In another
place, I was instructed to install a zipped up tarball. The setup failed
becuase it expected there to be a .git file in the directory. I
successfully downloaded the code by cloneing the repository, despite the
fact that this was not recommended. I can use some aspects of the code
but not all of them. For instance, my memory tells me that about 80% of
the test suite passed, thus many scripts failed. This was when I only
installed the frame-work, which was advised since installing the whole
package is huge and unnecessary since I am not solving all astrophysical
problems. However, I wasn’t able to use one of the gravity solvers that
was presented in the textbook ‘AstrophysicalRecipes The art of AMUSE’.
The install still has some codes that failed for instance: amuse-adaptb,
amuse-hermite-grx, amuse-mi6. However, I’m hoping that this isn’t
necessary. I want to educate myself and make some examples.</p>
<p>Installing other codes and figuring out their functionalities to me
has never been trivial. This is similar to galpy when I tried to figure
out particle spray method and got less than good results. Agama also
confused me a bit. The main point is that for each package, at the end
of the day I decided that it was easier and better if I solved the
problem myself with my own code. Because, even with the other packages,
I know that they can be used to solve other astrophysical problems and
it wasn’t clear to me how to make the codes solve my specific set of of
the restricted three body problems in a potential with other perturbers
flying around.</p>
<p>In this search, I also discovered another review called
<em>Computational methods for collisional stellar systems</em> by
Spurzem and Kamlah 2023. It is also interesting and instructive. I found
it insightful when they called NBody an industry. I think the story of
GRAPE and Makino is really interesting, how he build dedicated hardware
for the nbody problem which were great for 10 years but were quickly
replaced by GPU technology.</p>

<p>If we consider the following differential equation, <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{dy}{dt}=m\)</span>, whose general solution
is: <span class="math inline">\(y=mt+b\)</span>. If we are working
double-precision numbers who use 64-bits to represent real numbers, then
the general solution is only 16 bytes. However, if we use newton’s
method to find a particular solution given an initial condition <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, then we must evaluate <span
class="math inline">\(t_i,y_i\)</span> at each time step considered. The
data volume becomes <span class="math inline">\(2\times
N_\mathrm{steps}\times 8 \mathrm{bytes}\)</span>.</p>
<p>With numerical solutions in general, we have a set of initial
conditions, and evaluting Hamilton’s equations at them provides the
instantaneous evolution of the system. If we use a sufficiently small
time step, we can then find the next state of the system.
<em>Sufficiently small</em> means that the numerical solution converges
to the <em>true solution</em> and only differs by accumulated numerical
error from machine precision.</p>
