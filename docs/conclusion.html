Laia’s paper that used the first version of the code.</p>
<p>In this chapter, I summarize the works undertaken in this thesis and
reconnect it to the broader literature with proposing more avenues for
investigation.</p>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>In Chapter 1, I outlined the importance of stellar streams from
globular clusters, highlighting both their intrinsic scientific interest
and their role as probes for a wide range of astrophysical questions.
These include the chemical enrichment of the Universe, the assembly
history of the Milky Way, pathways of black hole formation, and
constraints on the global and local properties of the Galactic
gravitational field—particularly in relation to the detection of dark
matter.</p>
<p>In Chapter 2, I presented the exact equations of motion used to model
the formation of stellar streams from globular clusters, formulated as a
restricted three-body problem. I then explained how these equations can
be interpreted to describe the escape of stars through the Lagrange
points under tidal forces, followed by their evolution via phase mixing
to form the streams. I summarized the literature on the mechanisms by
which perturbations can create gaps. I also discussed the limitations of
our models: specifically, that without <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span>-body simulations or analytical
prescriptions for internal cluster dynamics, certain questions cannot be
addressed.</p>
<p>In Chapter 3, I introduced my simulation code, <code>tstrippy</code>,
describing its numerical solution of the equations of motion, its
performance in terms of accuracy and computation time, and a comparison
of two numerical schemes. I explained how the code is written in Fortran
and interfaced with Python via <code>f2py</code>, and provided a
minimal, <span>non</span>-working example illustrating the workflow from
the user’s perspective.</p>
<p>In Chapter 4, I presented <span class="citation"
data-cites="2023A&amp;A...673A..44F">Ferrone et al. (2023)</span>, in
which we simulated the expected tidal debris from the entire globular
cluster catalogue. These simulations have been made publicly available
and are now used by the community, including in searches for additional
tidal debris beyond some of the clusters in our sample <span
class="citation"
data-cites="2025arXiv250705590K 2025ApJ...988...39W">(Kuzma et al. 2025;
Wang et al. 2025)</span>.</p>
<p>In Chapter 5, I present <span class="citation"
data-cites="2025A&amp;A...699A.289F">Ferrone et al. (2025)</span>, where
we investigated how the Palomar 5 stellar stream responds to the
granularity of the Milky Way’s gravitational field—specifically, the
presence of other globular clusters. We showed that the internal
dynamics of globular clusters can strongly influence the morphology of
their stellar streams. In particular, gap formation from the fly-by of a
massive perturber requires very specific stream conditions: regions
close to the progenitor, where the morphology is still dominated by
epicyclic overdensities, are unfavorable for gap formation, as different
stellar packets respond differently to the perturbation and subsequently
drift out of phase. This is a new contribution, as previous studies
primarily considered the effects of random motions, such as velocity
dispersion.</p>
<h1 id="prospectives">Prospectives</h1>
<p>I think the good thing here is that we really focus on Milky Way
streams and globular clusters. Idealized toy models and set ups are good
for investigating new ideas and various types of theoretical phenomena
…However, …by focusing on the Milky Way, we can truly …know how much of
these we can expect to see, with what significance, and always tie back
around to the observations …</p>
<h1 id="future-works">Future works</h1>
<p>The ubiquity anf sensitivity of stellar streams really do make them
amazing for inferring properties of various distributions. There are
thus various avenues of investigation that can be taken on next. Some
phenomena still needs to be explored with numerical forward modeling.
Either for understanding physical mecanisms, or for obtaining
predictions on how often something should be observed. On the otherhand,
where the phenomena is well understood we can turn to observations to
begin actually perform the inference.</p>
<h2 id="dark-matter">Dark Matter</h2>
<p><em>forward modelling</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="2025arXiv250207781L">Lu et al. (2025)</span> just did what I
proposed to do for Strasbourg. But not exactly as I would do it. I need
to read it better. It looks like an amazing work…<span class="citation"
data-cites="2024arXiv241213144A">Adams et al. (2024)</span> used the
press-schecter foramlism to analyze about how many impacts we can expect
to see on the stream.</p>
<p>A paper just came out in which they did it. RIP</p>
<p><em>inference</em> What about the inference aspect? Can we reliably
transalte a distribution of gaps into an understanding of the Dark
Matter Distribution Function? Hierarchical Baesian modeling…</p>
<h2 id="the-gravitational-field-of-the-mw">The gravitational field of

<p>We wanted to investigate more stuff like spiral arms, the large and
small magallenic clouds.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="2023A&amp;A...673A.152I">Ishchenko
et al. (2023)</span> showed that within the last 5 gyr the potential was
stable enough where the orbital solutions are pretty stable.</p>
<p>Ibata 2024 made a good model. However it’s still axis symmetric. A
Malhan article showed that the structure of the MW can twist a stream. I
see that too in my simulations. This mecanism needs to be understood
theoretically better and also employed in the MW…</p>
<p>Yaaquib (2025) is showing that we can use streams to get at how the
gravitational field changes due the LMC infall…maybe in the
conclusion</p>

<p>What if we wanted to go further? Indeed at somepoint, this is just
considered other work or future considerations, or other research
questions entirely.</p>
<p>What if we wanted to further? this is certainly outside the scope of
our work, but we could consider the globular cluster formation.</p>
<p>The complexity doesn’t end here. For instance, we are unsure how
globular clusters form. There are some mechanisms proposed (cite the
extra galactic GC review). That review summarizes them as: (1), (2),
(3). However, to completely understand them would involve understanding
the chemical enrichment history of the universe. Starting from big-bang
nucleosysntehsis, to first generation stars (POP III), and how these
first stars chemically enrich the environment, and how the clusters form
from said environment. <span class="citation"
data-cites="2022A&amp;A...668A.191C">Corazza, Miranda, and Wuensche
(2022)</span> studied cluster formation in environments that were
enriched by just pop II stars or a mixture of pop III/II stars and
showed that pop III stars were necessary to enrich the environment
enough to reproduce current cluster qualtities.</p>
<p>However, from my literature review there does seem to be a gap
linking the chemical environment that could be enriched from a
combination of pop II/popIII stars and how cluster formation. At least
we know clusters are at least second generation (pop II) stars, since
the first stars (pop III) form massive and die young <span
class="citation" data-cites="2002ApJ...571...30S">(Schneider et al.
2002)</span>.</p>
<p>Ideally, we would like to know about the stars within the cluster to
then infer the environment that it must have been born in.
Extra-galactic census of globular clusters show that there isa
bi-modality in color, making people believe that there are at least two
generations or two different mechanisms for forming them.</p>

Wang (2025)</span> presents a cool scenario for investigating globular

chemical environment the clusters form in as an enrichment process from
POP III and POP II stars. I must read this more in detail. It is
fascinating work.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="2004AJ....127.2753D">Dehnen et al.
(2004)</span> presented a great work on Palomar 5 and found the
parameters of a king model that best reproduce Palomar 5. Perhaps I can
take form this study to have the best description of the tidal tails
that corresponds to Palomar 5, and iterate over this to have the best
description of of the tails as possible.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="2006ARA&amp;A..44..193B">Brodie
and Strader (2006)</span> made a review on extra galactic globular
clusters. They discuss things like the observation evidence, the
globular cluster mass function (all clusters), and find it to have an
equal power spectrum, but the issue is that you don’t know where to
truncate the power law. maybe at lower end you can argue <span
class="math inline">\(10^4 M_\odot\)</span> from two body relaxation and
a tidal field. However, the upper limit is hard since you already don’t
expect that many, and the inclusion of a couple more high mass members
can significantly alter the “mean” mass GC. They also note how a lot of
cluster properties match the galactic properties. They talk about a
bi-modal distribution. It really isn’t that bimodal, there’s a ton of
overlap. There’s a bluer one and a redder one. One of them might form
during the collisions between galaxies while the other could be formed
deeped in the potential wells. They also said that as of 2014 there is
evidence that GCs are still forming. They also discuss the chemical
abundance patterns within the clusters. It’s complicated stuff, I wish I
was better at stellar physics and knowing all the different
sequences…</p>
<p>Something about the chemical abundance patterns of the halo stars
that can be consistent with the globular clusters …</p>
<p>Schiavon (2017) showing that there exist many N-rich stars which have
chemical abundance patterns similar to stars within the clusters all
over the galactic field.</p>
<p>Fernández-Trincado, José G (2021) says that there are some metal rich
cluster debris, which is interesting</p>
<p>Fernández-Trincado, J. G (2017) said they found 11 stars with the
chemical abundance patterms of second general stars within globular
cluster …</p>
<h1 id="future-modeling-techinques">Future modeling techinques</h1>
<p>I want to integrate these discussions in smoothly with the other
scientific questions and not separate the modelling techinques.</p>
<h2 id="n-body-codes">N-body codes</h2>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="2012MNRAS.424..545N">(Nitadori and
Aarseth 2012)</span> showed the GPU’s can replace GRAPE</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="2018ComAC...5....2V">Varri et al.
(2018)</span> talks about a series of papers between a larger
collaboration of people who specialize in collisional dynamics and who
have performed a series of workshops together. The introduction stated
that the collaboration wants to tackle many open questions regarding
stellar clusters and build the necessary codes to interprete the future
large quantity of data that was destined to come. It has now come since
the review was 2018. An interesting point was that in general globular
clusters are approximated as being orderless, i.e. isotropic but order
does present itself within these stelalr systems. Another large problem
is no one knows what a good set of initial conditiosn is. Unresolved
binaries pose a problem because you can overestiamte the total mass of
the system. If I talk about this review, I should probably discuss some
of the results from the papers that is builds on or at least their
techinques.</p>
<p>The MODEST review led me to discover AMUSE, which is an framework for
integrating various astrophysical codes for solving 4 types of problems:
gravitational dynamics, radiative transfer, hydrodynamics, and stellar
evolution. The codes are written by the community and are interfaced
together with Amuse. The user end is python. I have spent some time
reading the book, which is instructive and well written. Steve McMillian
is one of the authors. The code has a large support on GitHub and is
still being developped. I have had trouble trying to install the code.
It seems as though their documentation is incoherrent. At one place, it
said ‘pip’ is the easiest way to install. It didn’t work. In another
place, I was instructed to install a zipped up tarball. The setup failed
becuase it expected there to be a .git file in the directory. I
successfully downloaded the code by cloneing the repository, despite the
fact that this was not recommended. I can use some aspects of the code
but not all of them. For instance, my memory tells me that about 80% of
the test suite passed, thus many scripts failed. This was when I only
installed the frame-work, which was advised since installing the whole
package is huge and unnecessary since I am not solving all astrophysical
problems. However, I wasn’t able to use one of the gravity solvers that
was presented in the textbook ‘AstrophysicalRecipes The art of AMUSE’.
The install still has some codes that failed for instance: amuse-adaptb,
amuse-hermite-grx, amuse-mi6. However, I’m hoping that this isn’t
necessary. I want to educate myself and make some examples.</p>
<p>Installing other codes and figuring out their functionalities to me
has never been trivial. This is similar to galpy when I tried to figure
out particle spray method and got less than good results. Agama also
confused me a bit. The main point is that for each package, at the end
of the day I decided that it was easier and better if I solved the
problem myself with my own code. Because, even with the other packages,
I know that they can be used to solve other astrophysical problems and
it wasn’t clear to me how to make the codes solve my specific set of of
the restricted three body problems in a potential with other perturbers
flying around.</p>
<p>In this search, I also discovered another review called
<em>Computational methods for collisional stellar systems</em> by
Spurzem and Kamlah 2023. It is also interesting and instructive. I found
it insightful when they called NBody an industry. I think the story of
GRAPE and Makino is really interesting, how he build dedicated hardware
for the nbody problem which were great for 10 years but were quickly
replaced by GPU technology.</p>
<h1 id="particle-spray-methods">particle-spray methods</h1>
<p>this could be really important if I want to come up with something
<em>fast</em> particularly if using</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="2012MNRAS.420.2700K">Küpper, Lane,
and Heggie (2012)</span> created the “streak-line” method, which in
essence approximates streams as having the same orbital parameters as
the progenitor. <span class="citation"
data-cites="2014ApJ...795...94B">Bonaca et al. (2014)</span> continued
this and used it to quickly generate streams in a monte-carlo code to
find the best halo parameters to reproduced observed streams to recover
a galaxy’s mass. They generate orbits on the fly giving the star
particles the same parameters as the progenitor but offset.</p>
<p>The “streak-line” method is limited and ignores the dispersion in
orbital parameters of the escaped stars. <span class="citation"
data-cites="2011MNRAS.413.1852E">Eyre and Binney (2011)</span> presented
streams in action-angle variables. As stated by <span class="citation"
data-cites="2015MNRAS.452..301F">Fardal, Huang, and Weinberg
(2015)</span>, this is the most elegant description of stellar streams.
Each stream star has an offset from the progenitor’s hamiltonian which
can be expressed with a second order taylor expansion.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="2015MNRAS.452..301F">Fardal,
Huang, and Weinberg (2015)</span> prescriptive stream generation model
could be much faster than my simulations. Yes, this model is
prescriptive but it the escape rate is tied to orbital properties, as is
mine. It can operate at the on the dynamical time of the galaxy and not
the dynamical time of the internal dynamics, which could greatly speed
up simulations. <span class="citation"
data-cites="2014ApJ...795...95B">Bovy (2014)</span> did a good job of
developing this in terms of the actions and angles. However, <span
class="citation" data-cites="2015MNRAS.452..301F">Fardal, Huang, and
Weinberg (2015)</span> provides an escape rate that is more motivated by
the orbit of the progenitor, which is good since we know more particles
escape at peri-center due to the scaling of tidal forces with <span
class="math inline">\(r^{-3}\)</span>. So the Fardal is pretty great.
Perhaps adopting one of these methods for certain problems could be
great.</p>
<p>The advantage of my method is that it is not prescriptive, so if we
explore a region of the parameter space where the assumptions behind the
prescriptions break down, we may be led astray. …but it’s so fast …</p>
