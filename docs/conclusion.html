<p>What if we wanted to go further? Indeed at somepoint, this is just
considered other work or future considerations, or other research
questions entirely.</p>
<p>What if we wanted to further? this is certainly outside the scope of
our work, but we could consider the globular cluster formation.</p>
<p>The complexity doesn’t end here. For instance, we are unsure how
globular clusters form. There are some mechanisms proposed (cite the
extra galactic GC review). That review summarizes them as: (1), (2),
(3). However, to completely understand them would involve understanding
the chemical enrichment history of the universe. Starting from big-bang
nucleosysntehsis, to first generation stars (POP III), and how these
first stars chemically enrich the environment, and how the clusters form
from said environment. <span class="citation"
data-cites="2022A&amp;A...668A.191C">Corazza, Miranda, and Wuensche
(2022)</span> studied cluster formation in environments that were
enriched by just pop II stars or a mixture of pop III/II stars and
showed that pop III stars were necessary to enrich the environment
enough to reproduce current cluster qualtities.</p>
<p>However, from my literature review there does seem to be a gap
linking the chemical environment that could be enriched from a
combination of pop II/popIII stars and how cluster formation. At least
we know clusters are at least second generation (pop II) stars, since
the first stars (pop III) form massive and die young <span
class="citation" data-cites="2002ApJ...571...30S">(R. Schneider et al.
2002)</span>.</p>
<p>Ideally, we would like to know about the stars within the cluster to
then infer the environment that it must have been born in.
Extra-galactic census of globular clusters show that there isa
bi-modality in color, making people believe that there are at least two
generations or two different mechanisms for forming them.</p>

<p><span class="citation" data-cites="2006ARA&amp;A..44..193B">Brodie
and Strader (2006)</span> made a review on extra galactic globular
clusters. They discuss things like the observation evidence, the
globular cluster mass function (all clusters), and find it to have an
equal power spectrum, but the issue is that you don’t know where to
truncate the power law. maybe at lower end you can argue <span
class="math inline">\(10^4 M_\odot\)</span> from two body relaxation and
a tidal field. However, the upper limit is hard since you already don’t
expect that many, and the inclusion of a couple more high mass members
can significantly alter the “mean” mass GC. They also note how a lot of
cluster properties match the galactic properties. They talk about a
bi-modal distribution. It really isn’t that bimodal, there’s a ton of
overlap. There’s a bluer one and a redder one. One of them might form
during the collisions between galaxies while the other could be formed
deeped in the potential wells. They also said that as of 2014 there is
evidence that GCs are still forming. They also discuss the chemical
abundance patterns within the clusters. It’s complicated stuff, I wish I
was better at stellar physics and knowing all the different
sequences…</p>

ZAMs. Pretty sick.</p>

and how the metals allow them to grow so much. I don’t know what the
WMAP eletron scatter probe is. I think they’re already talking about
detectability. and saying that if a scenario produces many eave pop III
stars, then it won’t be detectable in the WMAP data. Perhaps pop III
stars should do something to the electron scattering optical depth? What
is a Larson initial mass function?</p>

fascinating work.</p>

<p><span class="citation" data-cites="2018ComAC...5....2V">Varri et al.
(2018)</span> talks about a series of papers between a larger
collaboration of people who specialize in collisional dynamics and who
have performed a series of workshops together. The introduction stated
that the collaboration wants to tackle many open questions regarding
stellar clusters and build the necessary codes to interprete the future
large quantity of data that was destined to come. It has now come since
the review was 2018. An interesting point was that in general globular
clusters are approximated as being orderless, i.e. isotropic but order
does present itself within these stelalr systems. Another large problem
is no one knows what a good set of initial conditiosn is. Unresolved
binaries pose a problem because you can overestiamte the total mass of
the system. If I talk about this review, I should probably discuss some
of the results from the papers that is builds on or at least their
techinques.</p>
<p>The MODEST review led me to discover AMUSE, which is an framework for
integrating various astrophysical codes for solving 4 types of problems:
gravitational dynamics, radiative transfer, hydrodynamics, and stellar
evolution. The codes are written by the community and are interfaced
together with Amuse. The user end is python. I have spent some time
reading the book, which is instructive and well written. Steve McMillian
is one of the authors. The code has a large support on GitHub and is
still being developped. I have had trouble trying to install the code.
It seems as though their documentation is incoherrent. At one place, it
said ‘pip’ is the easiest way to install. It didn’t work. In another
place, I was instructed to install a zipped up tarball. The setup failed
becuase it expected there to be a .git file in the directory. I
successfully downloaded the code by cloneing the repository, despite the
fact that this was not recommended. I can use some aspects of the code
but not all of them. For instance, my memory tells me that about 80% of
the test suite passed, thus many scripts failed. This was when I only
installed the frame-work, which was advised since installing the whole
package is huge and unnecessary since I am not solving all astrophysical
problems. However, I wasn’t able to use one of the gravity solvers that
was presented in the textbook ‘AstrophysicalRecipes The art of AMUSE’.
The install still has some codes that failed for instance: amuse-adaptb,
amuse-hermite-grx, amuse-mi6. However, I’m hoping that this isn’t
necessary. I want to educate myself and make some examples.</p>
<p>Installing other codes and figuring out their functionalities to me
has never been trivial. This is similar to galpy when I tried to figure
out particle spray method and got less than good results. Agama also
confused me a bit. The main point is that for each package, at the end
of the day I decided that it was easier and better if I solved the
problem myself with my own code. Because, even with the other packages,
I know that they can be used to solve other astrophysical problems and
it wasn’t clear to me how to make the codes solve my specific set of of
the restricted three body problems in a potential with other perturbers
flying around.</p>
<p>In this search, I also discovered another review called
<em>Computational methods for collisional stellar systems</em> by
Spurzem and Kamlah 2023. It is also interesting and instructive. I found
it insightful when they called NBody an industry. I think the story of
GRAPE and Makino is really interesting, how he build dedicated hardware
for the nbody problem which were great for 10 years but were quickly
replaced by GPU technology.</p>
<h1 id="particle-spray-methods">particle-spray methods</h1>
<p>this could be really important if I want to come up with something
<em>fast</em> particularly if using</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="2012MNRAS.420.2700K">Küpper, Lane,
and Heggie (2012)</span> created the “streak-line” method, which in
essence approximates streams as having the same orbital parameters as
the progenitor. <span class="citation"
data-cites="2014ApJ...795...94B">Bonaca et al. (2014)</span> continued
this and used it to quickly generate streams in a monte-carlo code to
find the best halo parameters to reproduced observed streams to recover
a galaxy’s mass. They generate orbits on the fly giving the star
particles the same parameters as the progenitor but offset.</p>
<p>The “streak-line” method is limited and ignores the dispersion in
orbital parameters of the escaped stars. <span class="citation"
data-cites="2011MNRAS.413.1852E">Eyre and Binney (2011)</span> presented
streams in action-angle variables. As stated by <span class="citation"
data-cites="2015MNRAS.452..301F">Fardal, Huang, and Weinberg
(2015)</span>, this is the most elegant description of stellar streams.
Each stream star has an offset from the progenitor’s hamiltonian which
can be expressed with a second order taylor expansion.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="2015MNRAS.452..301F">Fardal,
Huang, and Weinberg (2015)</span> prescriptive stream generation model
could be much faster than my simulations. Yes, this model is
prescriptive but it the escape rate is tied to orbital properties, as is
mine. It can operate at the on the dynamical time of the galaxy and not
the dynamical time of the internal dynamics, which could greatly speed
up simulations. <span class="citation"
data-cites="2014ApJ...795...95B">Bovy (2014)</span> did a good job of
developing this in terms of the actions and angles. However, <span
class="citation" data-cites="2015MNRAS.452..301F">Fardal, Huang, and
Weinberg (2015)</span> provides an escape rate that is more motivated by
the orbit of the progenitor, which is good since we know more particles
escape at peri-center due to the scaling of tidal forces with <span
class="math inline">\(r^{-3}\)</span>. So the Fardal is pretty great.
Perhaps adopting one of these methods for certain problems could be
great.</p>
<p>The advantage of my method is that it is not prescriptive, so if we
explore a region of the parameter space where the assumptions behind the
prescriptions break down, we may be led astray. …but it’s so fast …</p>
