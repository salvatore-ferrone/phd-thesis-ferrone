<p>Driven by sheer curiosity and enabled by advances in technology, in
the early 1600s, Galileo turned the “Dutch perspective glass" toward the
heavens and began the modern era of astronomy. Then, in 2013, the
European Space Agency launched the Gaia space telescope, tasking it with
providing precise measurements of the positions and velocities of
billions of stars <span class="citation"
data-cites="2016A&amp;A...595A...1G">(Gaia Collaboration et al.
2016)</span>. This dataset represents a statistically significant sample
of stars, constituting 2-3% of the total number within the Galaxy. The
combination of this vast dataset with the revolutionary advances in
machine learning techniques has accelerated the discovery of what we
call “stellar streams." Stellar streams are distinctive groups of stars
that exhibit coherent motion, tracing elongated, arc-like patterns
across the celestial sphere. An illustrative sample of these stellar
streams is presented in Fig. <a href="#fig:ibata-2021"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:ibata-2021">1.1</a>. This
figure showcases the work of <span class="citation"
data-cites="2021ApJ...914..123I">Ibata et al. (2021)</span>, who have
identified and cataloged over 60 such streams within our Milky Way.</p>
<p>These remarkable findings served as a profound source of inspiration
for the inception of this thesis. They ignite a series of fundamental
questions: Where do these stellar streams originate? How many more of
these celestial ribbons exist in the Galaxy, awaiting discovery? What
insights can we glean about the gravitational dynamics of our Milky Way
through their study? And what other invaluable information can be
inferred from them? This thesis is dedicated to addressing these
overarching questions by embarking on a journey to model the formation
of stellar streams that emerge from Galactic globular clusters.</p>

</figure>
<p>The fundamental question of where stellar streams originate is well
understood. Stellar streams emerge from stars that have liberated
themselves from their original stellar systems, courtesy of the forces
generated by tidal interactions. Since stellar systems possess are not
points and have spatial extent, the region closer to the galactic center
of mass, around which they orbit, is subject to a stronger gravitational
pull compared to the far side. From the vantage point of the system’s
center, it appears as though both sides of the extended body are
gradually pulled away from the center, culminating in the disintegration
of the system and the eventual escape of stars.</p>
<p>This scenario is common for two reasons. The first being that in
systems tend to be more massive in the center, always giving rise
gravitational fields with gradients, although idealized examples exist
such as a uniform infinite sheet of mass. Additionally, self gravitating
stellar systems are common. Consequently, stellar streams are ubiquitous
across the universe. They materialize when a smaller object is drawn
into the gravitational clutches of a larger, more massive counterpart.
An illustrative example is the Sagittarius stream, a relic of stars that
once belonged to a dwarf galaxy entirely consumed by our Milky Way <span
class="citation" data-cites="2001ApJ...551..294I">(Ibata, Lewis, et al.
2001)</span>. Notably, similar streams may be found in other galaxies,
as is the case with the stream encompassing Andromeda (M31) <span
class="citation" data-cites="2001Natur.412...49I">(Ibata, Irwin, et al.
2001)</span>.</p>
<p>Another intriguing source of stellar streams that could account for
the observed streams in Fig.<a href="#fig:ibata-2021"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:ibata-2021">1.1</a> is
none other than globular clusters. Globular clusters are stellar systems
characterized by containing between <span
class="math inline">\(10^5-10^6\)</span> stars arranged in a spherical
distribution. The very first stellar stream known to originate from a
globular cluster was Palomar 5, as documented in <span class="citation"
data-cites="2001ApJ...548L.165O">(Odenkirchen et al. 2001)</span>. In
such an early study, the discovery of this streams involved identifying
an over-density of stars in the vicinity of a globular cluster, followed
by a meticulous separation of true stream members from false positives
based on color-magnitude data <span class="citation"
data-cites="2003AJ....126.2385O">(Odenkirchen et al. 2003)</span>.
Kinematics at the time were not available for large amounts of stars.
Interestingly, <span class="citation"
data-cites="2009AJ....137.3378O">Odenkirchen et al. (2009)</span>
revisited the Palomar 5 stream using the Very Large Telescope (VLT) to
collect line-of-sight velocity measurements. They were able to confirm
that the stars within the stream exhibited matching motion to those
within the originating cluster. This methodology is starkly contrasted
by those in <span class="citation"
data-cites="2021ApJ...914..123I">Ibata et al. (2021)</span>, whose
search was agnostic. Thanks to the large amounts of data, streams were
searched for all over the celestial sphere without targeting specific
regions of interest. An interesting consequence of this, is that many of
the streams showcased in Fig.<a href="#fig:ibata-2021"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:ibata-2021">1.1</a> do not
have known progenitors.</p>
<p>Stellar streams serve as invaluable diagnostic tools for
investigating various aspects of our Milky Way galaxy. One of the
pressing mysteries is the distribution of dark matter. An interesting
characteristic of stellar streams is that they generally trace the orbit
of the progenitor. By doing so, they can be used to perform inference
problems to constrain the gravitational potential of their host galaxy,
as highlighted by prior studies such as <span class="citation"
data-cites="2011MNRAS.417..198V">Varghese, Ibata, and Lewis
(2011)</span>.</p>
<p>Moreover, the utility of stellar streams in probing the gravitational
field within which they orbit opens the door to intriguing tests of
different cosmological hypotheses. A striking example is the GD-1
stream, a well-known stellar stream that has been employed to scrutinize
various scenarios, as documented in <span class="citation"
data-cites="2018ApJ...863L..20P">(Price-Whelan and Bonaca 2018)</span>.
Currently, the question of whether globular clusters are formed within
dark matter subhalos remains uncertain. A notable investigation by <span
class="citation" data-cites="2019ApJ...881..106M">Malhan et al.
(2019)</span> utilized numerical simulations to demonstrate that the
diffuse stellar debris surrounding the GD-1 stream presents compelling
evidence of its progenitor cluster forming within a dark matter
halo.</p>
<p>Further enriching our understanding, <span class="citation"
data-cites="2021hst..prop16791B">(Bonaca et al. 2021)</span> explored
the unique ‘gap’ within the GD-1 stream, conducting detailed numerical
simulations to constrain the size and mass of the perturbing influence
responsible for this feature. Intriguingly, their findings challenge the
compatibility of observed gaps with the sizes of dark matter subhalos
predicted by the <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span>-CDM
cosmological model. These compelling lines of inquiry underscore the
multifaceted role of stellar streams in advancing our knowledge of the
Milky Way’s dynamics and the nature of dark matter.</p>
<p>Unlike the aforementioned studies, my research focuses on examining
the collective tidal debris originating from all of the galactic
globular clusters, rather than concentrating solely on individual
stellar streams. To do so, I leverage a data set of their current known
properties that has been refined over the years across multiple studies.
In <span class="citation" data-cites="2021MNRAS.505.5957B">Baumgardt and
Vasiliev (2021)</span>, the authors harnessed a diverse range of data
sources, including Gaia DR2 data, the Hubble Space Telescope, and other
datasets from the astronomical literature and subsequently determined
accurate distances to a multitude of Galactic globular clusters.
Furthermore, <span class="citation"
data-cites="2017MNRAS.464.2174B">Baumgardt (2017)</span> use N-Body
modeling to construct a staggering 900 simulated globular clusters under
various initial conditions, subsequently fitting these models to
observed clusters to delve into their internal properties. Building on
this foundation, the N-body models were extended to encompass additional
galactic globular clusters through the integration of data from the
Hubble Space Telescope and Gaia DR2, as detailed in <span
class="citation" data-cites="2020IAUS..351..451H">Hilker et al.
(2020)</span>. This comprehensive work initiated an invaluable online
data repository designed to store the kinematic and structural
parameters of galactic globular clusters <span class="citation"
data-cites="2021yCat..74781520B">(Baumgardt and Hilker 2021)</span>.
Initially, this catalog contained orbital and internal properties for
145 globular clusters. With the advent of the third data release from
the Gaia mission <span class="citation"
data-cites="2021A&amp;A...650C...3G">(Gaia Collaboration et al.
2021)</span>, this dataset has expanded its coverage to include a total
of 165 globular clusters <span class="citation"
data-cites="2021MNRAS.505.5978V">(Vasiliev and Baumgardt 2021)</span>.
These datasets now serve as the foundation for the initial conditions in
our simulations, facilitating a more in-depth examination of the tidal
debris from galactic globular clusters.</p>
<p>In the subsequent sections of this report, I describe key aspects of
our research. I begin by providing a detailed exploration of the physics
underlying tidal stripping in Section <a href="#sec:ThePhysics"

in Section <a href="#sec:Computer" data-reference-type="ref"

the results, some of which have already been published in <span

ongoing work, which is currently in the process of being assembled for

<p>It is intriguing to draw a comparison between ’stellar dynamics’ and
’celestial dynamics.’ In essence, this involves contrasting the motion
of stars within a galaxy with the motion of celestial bodies within our
solar system. In the solar system, the gravitational field is known to
high precision. Typically, one starts by considering the Sun and then
introduces additional complexities as required by the specific problem
at hand. For instance, if the goal is to send the James Webb Space
Telescope into orbit around the Sun-Earth <span
class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> Lagrange point, a first-order
computation does not necessitate the inclusion of all other planets in
the system. Similarly, if the aim is to investigate the long-term
evolution of comet orbits, one considers the effects of the Sun and
Jupiter on the orbit of the comet, perhaps Saturn as well. In essence,
the approach entails identifying the most influential bodies in the
system and then applying principles derived from the restricted three-
or four-body problem.</p>
<p>In the realm of galactic dynamics, the paradigm differs
significantly. To begin with, we are dealing with an immense number of
stars—billions, to be precise. However, when considering the orbits of
bodies within the Galaxy, we need not account for direct star-star
interactions. A compelling rationale for this can be found in Chapter
1.2.1 of <span class="citation" data-cites="2008gady.book.....B">Binney
and Tremaine (2008)</span>, where the authors demonstrate that direct
stellar encounters are exceedingly rare, with their cumulative effects
on significantly changing a star’s momentum being substantial only after
a staggering timescale of 10<span class="math inline">\(^{16}\)</span>
years—a duration far surpassing the age of the universe.</p>
<p>As a result, our focus shifts from individual stars to the continuous
density distribution of stars throughout the Galaxy. Consequently, the
paradigm in galactic dynamics revolves around employing observational
evidence to constrain the mass adistribution, ultimately leading to the
determination and validation of the gravitational field. This process
hinges on arguably one of the most pivotal equations in dynamics, known
as Poisson’s equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\nabla^2 \Phi = 4\pi G
\rho.\]</span></p>
<p>To present this equation in a more intuitive fashion, we can shift
our focus from examining the Laplacian of the potential to analyzing the
divergence of the gravitational field. This is feasible because the
gravitational field is ’conservative,’ signifying that it arises from
the gradient of a scalar-valued function, which is the gravitational
potential. In other words, we can express this relationship as: <span
class="math inline">\(\nabla \Phi = - \vec{g}\)</span>. The negative
sign signifies that the gravitational force doesn’t act in the direction
of the steepest ascent, but rather in the direction of descent.
Consequently, through this substitution, Poisson’s equation can be
reformulated as: <span class="math display">\[\nabla \cdot \vec {g} =
-4\pi G \rho,\]</span> This equation provides a captivating physical
insight: if we visualize a gravitational field as a fluid, a mass
behaves like a ’sink.’ As the density increases, the rate at which this
’matter-fluid’ flows toward the mass also intensifies. Moving forward,
it’s valuable to approach Poisson’s equation in integral form, which
aids in determining the mass distribution of the gravitational field.
This is achieved by initially integrating over a volume and subsequently
applying the divergence theorem. The theorem allows us to transition
from evaluating the divergence of the gravitational field within a
volume to instead considering the flux passing through a surface.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, by performing a volume integral over the density, we
can derive the mass profile. The key challenge lies in selecting
appropriate integration limits to ensure that the gravitational field
and the normal vectors of the chosen surface are consistently parallel.
Consequently, the right-hand side of the equation is often treated as:
<span class="math display">\[\int \left(\nabla \cdot \vec{g} \right) dV
= \oint \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{S} = g SA.\]</span> Simultaneously, the
right hand-side is treated as: <span class="math display">\[4\pi G \int
\rho dV = 4\pi G M_{\textrm{enc}},\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(M_{\textrm{enc}}\)</span> is the mass enclosed
within the same surface. In the end, these two quantities can be
related: <span
class="math display">\[\label{EQ:force_from_enclosed_mass}
    \vec{g} = \frac{4\pi G M_{\textrm{enc}}}{SA} \hat{n},\]</span> where
the unit vector is re-introduced given the symmetry chosen symmetry of
the problem. This quickly gives rise to the familiar Keplerian case,
when the mass enclosed is a point mass and the equi-potential surface is
a sphere, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(SA=4\pi r^2\)</span>, and we
will have re-derived Newton’s law of gravitation: <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{g} = \frac{G M}{r^2} \hat{r}\)</span>.</p>
<p>A series of exercises can subsequently be undertaken. If a high
degree of symmetry is present, and a chosen density distribution is
given, one can straightforwardly determine the gravitational field. Some
basic exercises include finding the gravitational field of: a point
mass, a uniform sphere, a sphere with increasing mass, an infinitely
large sheet, and so on. The reverse approach is also possible, in which
one first selects the form of the potential and then applies the
Laplacian to deduce the density distribution. An example, and a
potential that I employ in my thesis, is the Plummer distribution:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Phi(r|M,b) = \frac{GM}{\sqrt{r^2 +
b^2}}.\]</span> This can be understood as a point mass that has been
smeared by some characteristic length, <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. There exists another famous model
which applies the same softening principle, the Hernquist: <span
class="math inline">\(\Phi(r) = \frac{GM}{r + b}\)</span> <span
class="citation" data-cites="1990ApJ...356..359H">(Hernquist
1990)</span>. Additionally one can move to distributions with
cylindrical symmetry, an example of a model I employ in my thesis is the
Myamoto-Nagai <span class="citation"
data-cites="1975PASJ...27..533M">(Miyamoto and Nagai 1975)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[\Phi\left(R,z|M,a,b\right) = \frac{GM}{\sqrt{R^2
+ \left(\sqrt{z^2 + b^2} + a\right)^2}},\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is the characteristic disc length, and
<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is the characteristic disc
height. Interestingly, if <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is set
to zero, a Plummer distribution is recovered. Another important model
that I will present here is the Allan-Santillian Halo model. But first,
there is an important concept to introduce that is often used as a
diagnostic tool for galaxies, known as the ’rotation curve.’ In essence,
we can measure the net rotation of a galaxy by determining the
rotational speed of its constituent stars. A body in a circular orbit
has all of its kinetic energy in rotational velocity, and thus the
centripetal force counterbalances gravity when <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{v_c^2}{r} = g\)</span>. We can use EQ. <a
href="#EQ:force_from_enclosed_mass" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="EQ:force_from_enclosed_mass">[EQ:force_from_enclosed_mass]</a>
to relate the circular velocity to the enclosed mass, as in the case of
spherical symmetry, as: <span class="math display">\[v_c = \sqrt{\frac{G
M_{\textrm{enc}}}{r}}.\]</span> Considering this relationship, and the
empirical observation that many external galaxies exhibit nearly
constant rotation curves at greater distances, <span class="citation"
data-cites="1986RMxAA..13..137A">C. Allen and Martos (1986)</span>
proposed a halo potential characterized by mass increasing linearly with
distance, resulting in a consistent rotational speed. This concept can
be mathematically expressed through the following power law: <span
class="math display">\[M_{\textrm{enc}}\left(r|M_0,\beta,\gamma\right) =
\frac{M_{0}\left(r/\beta\right)^{\gamma}}{\left(1+\left(r/\beta\right)\right)^{\gamma-1}}.\]</span>
In this formulation, the mass diverges, rendering the model
non-physical. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(M_0\)</span>
doesn’t represent the total mass but rather serves as a parameter
defining the rate at which mass accumulates with increasing distance. On
the other hand, <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> denotes a
scale length parameter, indicating distances under which mass
accumulation is minimal. This potential is referred to as a ‘halo’
potential because it aims to simulate the presence of the dark matter
halo enveloping the Galaxy. It’s worth noting that, in practice, halos
contribute less to the interior of galaxies when compared to visible
matter. Another essential consideration is determining the radius at
which to truncate the halo. In our article, we adhered to the convention
proposed in earlier studies, choosing to truncate it at 100 kpc. This
yields the following potential: <span
class="math display">\[\Phi\left(r|M_t,\gamma,\beta,r_\mathrm{c}\right)
= -\frac{GM_t}{r} -
\frac{GM_t}{\left(\gamma-1\right)\beta}\left.\left[\frac{\left(\gamma-1\right)}{1+\left(r&#39;/\beta\right)^{\gamma-1}}
-
\ln\left(1+\left(r&#39;/\beta\right)^{\gamma-1}\right)\right]\right|_{r_c}^{r},\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(r_0\)</span> is the truncation radius,
<span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is the power parameter whose
best fit value was found to be 2.02, and <span
class="math inline">\(M_t\)</span> is the total mass. These values for
all of the can be found in Table 1 of <span class="citation"
data-cites="2023A&amp;A...673A..44F">Ferrone et al. (2023)</span>.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="the-laplacian-is-a-linear-operator">The
Laplacian is a linear operator</h4>
<p>It is important to note that the Laplacian is a linear operator, i.e.
<span class="math inline">\(\nabla^2\left(a_0\Phi_0 + a_1\Phi_1\right) =
a_0\nabla^2\Phi_0 + a_1\nabla^2 \Phi_1\)</span>. Likewise, the right
hand-side of Poisson’s equation is multiplication, which is a linear.
Therefore both the total potential and the total density of a system can
be described as a sum of simpler parts:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\nabla^2 \left(\Phi_0 + \Phi_1 + \dots +
\Phi_N \right) = 4\pi G \left(\rho_0 + \rho_1 + \dots + \rho_N
\right).\]</span> This is fundamental when creating models and allows us
to dissect the Milky Way into parts based on different pieces of
observational motivation. This is what is done by many Galactic
potential models: <span class="citation"

(1991)</span>, <span class="citation"
data-cites="2017MNRAS.465...76M">(McMillan 2017)</span>, and lastly, the
potential model that we employ this this work, <span class="citation"

(1991)</span>. One of the models consists of a small central bugle
described by a Plummer, two Miyamoto-Nagai disks, and a Allen-Santillian
halo. The second model consits of two discs and the dark matter halo
only.</p>
<h3 id="sec:DistributionFunctionSampling">Distribution Function
Sampling</h3>
<p>In this thesis, my objective is to simulate the integration of
star-particles’ orbits within Galactic globular clusters and observe
their escape, forming tidal tails. A crucial aspect is the accurate
establishment of initial conditions for these star-particles. To achieve
this, I have drawn inspiration from chapter 4 of <span class="citation"
data-cites="2008gady.book.....B">Binney and Tremaine (2008)</span>,
which have informed this section. To begin, the distribution of stars
within the system of interest is described by a six-dimensional
distribution function over the phase space variables, denoted as <span
class="math inline">\(f\left(\vec{x},\vec{v}\right)\)</span>. Given that
this is a distribution function, it is inherently normalized.
Consequently, when integrated over the phase space variables, the result
is equal to 1: <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}=\int
f\left(\vec{x},\vec{v}\right) d^3\vec{x}d^3\vec{v}=1.\)</span> Another
assumption that is made in DF modeling is that the phase-space volume is
constant. i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\frac{d f}{dt}=0\)</span>. By
applying the derivative and chain rule, we obtain: <span
class="math display">\[\frac{df}{dt} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} +
\frac{\partial f}{\partial
\vec{x}}\cdot\frac{d\vec{x}}{dt}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial
\vec{v}}\cdot\frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = 0.\]</span> In practice, this
equation is stating that stars are not being created or destroyed, which
is not strictly true but satisfactory for our purposes. For instance,
stars in globular clusters are very light and not massive enough to go
super nova. Additionally, stars within globular clusters are old, and
gas-less thus are not creating stars.</p>
<p>Next, this equation is manipulated for various physical
configurations, i.e. if this mass distribution is spherical, or if the
velocity of the stars are <em>isotropic</em> (equally random in all
directions), or if there is anisotropy, i.e. a correlation between the
velocities of stars. In my thesis thus far, I have analyzed one of the
simplest cases, an Isotropic Plummer distribution. To do this, I have
taken the result that the distribution function depends only on the
energy as: <span class="math display">\[\label{EQ:plummerDF}
    f\left(E\right)\propto E^{-7/2},\]</span> Here, the energy, denoted
as <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, combines the kinetic and
potential energies, and it is expressed as: <span
class="math inline">\(E=\frac{1}{2}v^2 + \frac{GM}{\sqrt{r^2 +
b^2}}\)</span>. Armed with this knowledge, we can formulate a set of
initial conditions for a globular cluster, taking into account its
specific mass and characteristic radius.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="inverse-transform-sampling">Inverse Transform
Sampling</h4>
<p>Inverse transform sampling is a highly practical technique for
generating a set of discrete realizations from any probability density
function. In theory, it operates as follows: Let <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> be the cumulative
distribution function (CDF) of a given probability density function,
denoted as <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[\mathcal{F}\left(x\right) = \int_{-\infty}^{x}
f\left(x&#39;\right)dx&#39;.\]</span> The probability of drawing any
number <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, to be less than <span
class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span>, is the value of the CDF at <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[\mathcal{P}\left(x &lt; x_0\right) =
\mathcal{F}\left(x\right).\]</span> Since CDFs are monotonically
increasing and one-to-one with the independent variable, we can
substitute: <span class="math display">\[\mathcal{P}(F(x)&lt;F(x_0)) =
\mathcal{P}(x&lt;x_0).\]</span> Now we may introduce a random variable
<span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, whose value is equally probably
between [0,1], which is described by a DF of: <span
class="math display">\[f(y) = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; \text{if } y \in
[0,1] \\ 0 &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases}\]</span> We can
substitute, stating that the probability of drawing a uniform random
value between [0,1] is the same probability of drawing a value <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> as being less than the value of
interest: <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span>. <span
class="math display">\[\mathcal{P}\left(Y&lt;\mathcal{F}(x_0)\right) =
\mathcal{P}(x&lt;x_0).\]</span> Again, since the CDF and <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> are monotonically related and
one-to-one, we can apply the inverse transform to the left hand side:
<span
class="math display">\[\mathcal{P}\left(\mathcal{F}^{-1}(Y)&lt;x_0\right)
= \mathcal{P}(x&lt;x_0),\]</span> which in turn leads to the desired
result that: <span class="math display">\[\mathcal{F}^{-1}\left(Y\right)
= x.\]</span> In practice, you can visualize this equation as follows:
imagine plotting any CDF against the independent variable, and then
randomly drawing horizontal lines with heights between [0,1] from
negative infinity. Observe where these lines intersect the CDF, which
determines the corresponding <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>
values.</p>
<p>For instance, consider the Plummer sphere. We wish to sample this
distribution to find a set of initial conditions for <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> particles. The CDF of the normalized
mass distribution is as shown in Fig. <a
href="#fig:inverse-transform-sampling" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:inverse-transform-sampling">2.1</a>. The fraction of
the total enclosed mass, denoted as <span
class="math inline">\(M_X\)</span> as a function of distance scaled to
the characteristic length, <span class="math inline">\(r_X =
r/b\)</span>, is: <span class="math display">\[M_X =
\frac{r_X^3}{\left(1+r_X^2 \right)^{3/2}}.\]</span> The plot shown in
Fig. <a href="#fig:inverse-transform-sampling" data-reference-type="ref"

radius of 10.</p>

The CDF shown in the top panel is the enclosed mass of a Plummer sphere,

</figure>
<p>Applying inverse transform sampling to this mass distribution
provides the radial distances from the center of the system. Next, we
need to find the angular positions on the unit sphere. One may naively
attempt to uniformly sample the polar and azimuthal angles, <span
class="math inline">\(\theta,\phi\)</span>, however this would
incorrectly bunch up points at the poles. One must instead consider a DF
in which sampling equally probable in all areas. The argument is as
follow, first: <span class="math inline">\(\int f dA&#39; = 1\)</span>
where we are integrating over a unit sphere. We know that <span
class="math inline">\(\int dA = 4\pi\)</span>, thus, <span
class="math inline">\(f dA&#39; = (1/4\pi) dA\)</span>. Note that <span
class="math inline">\(dA&#39;\)</span> does not equal <span
class="math inline">\(dA\)</span>. Next, on a sphere the infinitesimal
surface area is <span class="math inline">\(dA = \sin(\theta)d\theta
d\phi\)</span>. We can now related this to the DF, <span
class="math inline">\(f=(1/4\pi)\sin(\theta)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(dA&#39; =d\theta d\phi\)</span>. This DF is used
to find the CDF, which is then used to randomly sample the angles.
Notice that it does not depend on <span
class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>, which is thus sampled from a
uniform DF, which is a linear CDF that ranges [0,1] and runs over
[0,<span class="math inline">\(2\pi\)</span>].</p>
<p>Lastly, sampling the velocities is not independent from the from the
position, so we must consider the conditional DF: <span
class="math inline">\(f(v|r)\)</span> from Eq. <a href="#EQ:plummerDF"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="EQ:plummerDF">[EQ:plummerDF]</a>. The number density of
particles at a point, <span class="math inline">\(\vec{x}\)</span>, is
found by integrating the velocities, i.e. <span
class="math inline">\(N(\vec{x})=\int
f(\vec{v}|\vec{x})d^3\vec{v}\)</span>. Note that another way of writing
a probability density function, is <span
class="math inline">\(f&#39;=\frac{dN}{dv}\)</span>. Also note that
because we are assuming the velocities are equally random in all
directions, we may find <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{dN}{dv}\)</span> by integrating then total
DF and then differentiate with respect to <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{dN}{dv} = \frac{d}{dv}\int
f(\vec{v}|\vec{x}) (v\sin\theta&#39;d\phi&#39;)(vd\theta&#39;)(dv) =
4\pi v^2 f(v|\vec{x}),\]</span> which gives the number density per
particle speed. Note that the angles here are not in physical space but
rather velocity space. Lastly, to construct the CDF of this DF, we must
know what the proper limits are. The speeds available to this particle
range from zero to the escape speed, which is <span
class="math inline">\(v_{esc}=\sqrt{2\Phi(r)}\)</span>. Thus, the CDF
is: <span class="math display">\[\label{EQ:CDF-velocities}
    CDF(v) = C \int_0^{v&lt;v_{esc}} 4\pi v^2 f(v|\vec{x}) dv,\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is a normalization
constant. In practice, we ignore this constant because for each particle
position, we find the non-normalized CDF and then divide by the final
value to normalize it. This process is visualized in Fig. <a
href="#fig:cdf-velocities" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:cdf-velocities">2.2</a>. Once the speeds are found,
the orientations of the velocity vectors can by found by randomly
sampling x,y,z values from uniform random distributions between [-1,1]
and then re-normalizing the resultant vector and multiplying it by the
final speed.</p>

and the Restricted Three Body Problem</h3>
<p>With the potential-density pairs discussed in section <a

data-reference="SEC:potential-density-pairs">2.1.1</a> and a method in
place for generating initial positions within a sphere of
star-particles, the stage is set to address a fundamental question:
<em>What causes stars to escape from globular clusters?</em></p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="tidal-forces">Tidal Forces</h4>
<p>As any good physicist would do, we will first solve a simpler problem
and draw insights from it while considering the more complex problem at
hand. Instead of considering the Galaxy exerting a force on a globular
cluster, consider the gravitational force from a point mass acting on
three points along a line: <span class="math inline">\(r-\delta
r\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(r+\delta r\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(\delta r&lt;&lt; r\)</span>. We can perform a
Taylor expansion to approximate the force to second order at the
interior and exterior points. <span
class="math display">\[F_{inside}=-\frac{GMm}{\left(r-\delta r\right)^2}
\sim -\frac{GMm}{r^2}\left[1+\frac{2\delta r}{r}\right]\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[F_{outside}=-\frac{GMm}{\left(r+\delta
r\right)^2} \sim -\frac{GMm}{r^2}\left[1-\frac{2\delta
r}{r}\right]\]</span> When describing these forces relative to the
center of mass of the body located at <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, we subtract the force vector upon the
center and see that the opposite sides of the body are being ripped away
from the center with a force:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[F_{\mathrm{tidal}}\sim 2GMm \frac{\delta
r}{r^3}.\]</span> By positioning an extended body in a gravitational
field where the gravitational pull is stronger closer to the center than
at a greater distance, it results in tidal forces. It’s worth noting the
functional form of the tidal force originating from the center of mass
of the object: this force increases linearly with distance from the
center of the object. Additionally, it follows an inverse-cubed
relationship between the distance to the host, making it considerably
weaker than the gravitational force.</p>
<p>This is a suitable qualitative comparison. Even though the galactic
gravitational field is not Keplerian, as in the previous example, it’s
well-established that the gravitational field still exhibits a gradient
and is more pronounced toward the center. Furthermore, globular clusters
are inherently extended, spherical bodies. Therefore, based on the
previous example, we anticipate that globular clusters will undergo
deformation along the radial direction, with those farther from the
center cluster experiencing more significant deformation than those
situated farther away.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered"
id="the-circular-restricted-planar-three-body-problem">The circular
restricted-planar three body problem</h4>
<p>Another simpler system to draw parallels with, as we aim to establish
a theoretical conceptual framework, is the restricted three-body
problem. In this scenario, we analyze two masses that mutually affect
each other and a third particle that doesn’t exert any gravitational
force but is influenced by the other two bodies. A well-known instance
of this is the Sun-Earth-Spacecraft setup. While the theory for this
section will be further elaborated in the thesis, my objective here is
to offer a broad overview of the mechanics.</p>
<p>In essence, when examining the restricted three-body problem, we
further simplify this scenario. Initially, we assume that the two larger
bodies are in circular orbits around the center of mass. This enables us
to establish a non-inertial reference frame that rotates at a constant
angular velocity, matching that of the two larger bodies. Subsequently,
we analyze the situation in which the third particle orbits within the
same plane as the two massive bodies. Despite these simplifications, we
can derive potent physical tools for comprehending tidal phenomena.
Firstly, we begin by formulating the Lagrangian of the third particle:
<span class="math display">\[\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{inertial frame}} =
T(\dot{x},\dot{y},\dot{z}=0)-U(x,y,z=0,t)\]</span> When we analyze the
problem within an inertial frame, the potential energy is time-dependent
motion since the larger two bodies are in motion with respect to the
reference frame, leading to increased complexities. Consequently, we
transition to a non-inertial reference frame, rotating at the same
angular velocity as the two massive bodies. Given our simplification of
the problem to circular orbits, the massive bodies remain fixed at
points along the x-axis. While this approach eliminates the time
dependence of the potential energy, it introduces a spatial dependence
to the kinetic energy: <span
class="math display">\[\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{rotating frame}} =
T(x,y,z=0,\dot{x},\dot{y},\dot{z})-U(x,y,z=0)\]</span> Recall the
two-body problem, where we introduced polar coordinates and observed
that the kinetic energy also depends on the spatial coordinate,
expressed as <span class="math inline">\((1/2)m\left(\dot{R}^2
+(R\omega)^2 \right)\)</span>. To delve deeper into the problem, we
shifted this spatial dependence to the potential energy, giving rise to
an <em>effective</em> potential energy. The same approach is applied to
the three-body problem. In this case, we seek locations where the
effective potential exhibits critical points. The critical points of the
effective potential in the three-body problem are referred to as the
<em>Lagrange points</em>.</p>
<p>Much like the two-body problem, the three-body problem exhibits
distinct categories of orbits based on the total energy. When the total
energy is positive, bodies follow hyperbolic orbits; zero energy results
in parabolic orbits; negative energy leads to bounded eccentric orbits,
and the minimum energy corresponds to circular orbits. Just as in the
two-body problem, the three-body problem can be subdivided into
different “realms” of possible orbits based on the total energy.</p>
<p>In one of these realms, a particle is initially bound to the less
massive secondary. It can transition to having its dynamics dominated by
the primary body if it possesses a certain level of energy. This
transition from being influenced by the secondary to the primary occurs
at the <em>first Lagrange point</em>. To locate this point, one sets the
effective potential equal to zero for a particle along the x-axis in the
rotating frame. Remarkably, determining the position of the Lagrange
point involves solving a quintic polynomial for which no exact analytic
solution exists. Consequently, the location of the Lagrange point is
always reported as an approximation.</p>
<p>Another intriguing concept that arises from this analysis is the
<em>Hill</em> sphere, which can be defined as the sphere encompassing
the secondary body within which its gravitational force prevails in
influencing the motion of a test particle. Mathematically, this sphere
can be expressed as: <span class="math display">\[r_h =
a\left(\frac{m_1}{3\left(m_0+m_1\right)}\right)^{1/3},\]</span> where
<span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is the semi-major axis of the
orbit between the two bodies, and there masses are <span
class="math inline">\(m_0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(m_1\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="phase-mixing">Phase-Mixing</h3>
<p>Another important concept that will serve to interpret the results is
<em>phase-mixing</em>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Phase-mixing occurs when we an
initial distribution of points in phase-space about some location, <span
class="math inline">\(r,v\)</span> with some spread or
<em>dispersion</em>, <span class="math inline">\(\delta r,
\sigma_{v}\)</span>, naturally spread over time and eventually uniformly
distribute themselves over all possible configurations allowed by the
system. A good way to estimate the time scale over which this occurs is
to look at the maximum difference in frequencies between two particles
complete phase space orbits:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\tau_{\textrm{phase-mixing}} =
\frac{2\pi}{\Delta f}.\]</span> Again, to gain physical insight, we can
look to the Kerplerian case for some quick estimates. From Kepler’s
third law, we know the relationship between orbit period and the
semi-major axis of an orbit: <span
class="math inline">\(T_{\textrm{dyn}}^2\propto a^3\)</span>. We can
estimate the difference in frequencies by studying the orbits of two
points, <span class="math inline">\(r+\delta r\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(r-\delta r\)</span>. This would then lead to:
<span class="math display">\[\Delta f \propto \left(\left(r+\delta

performing two Taylor expansions by assuming that <span
class="math inline">\(\delta r &lt;&lt; r\)</span> and substituting
<span class="math inline">\(T_{\mathrm{dyn}}\)</span> for <span
class="math inline">\(r^3\)</span>, we arrive to the relationship that:
<span class="math display">\[\tau_{\textrm{phase-mixing}} \approx
T_{\mathrm{dyn}}\left(1-6\frac{\delta r}{r}\right).\]</span> For the
case of the globular clusters, a typical scale size is five parsecs,
while their orbital radii are on the scale of kilo-parsecs. This large
difference in size renders the characteristic time for phase mixing to
be approximately equivalent to a dynamical time, <span
class="math inline">\(\tau_{\textrm{phase-mixing}} \approx
T_{\mathrm{dyn}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>While this quick analysis gives us some powerful insight, this <span
class="math inline">\(\tau_{\textrm{phase-mixing}}\)</span> time is an
under estimate. This is largely due to the fact that the gravitational
pull of the globular cluster keeps its star close. Thus, the real phase
mixing will be larger than the dynamical time. Nonetheless, this serves
as a first order guide. We expect that clusters whose <span
class="math inline">\(T_{\mathrm{dyn}}\)</span> is much less than the
duration of the simulation will have totally mixed tidal debris. Whereas
those with <span class="math inline">\(T_{\mathrm{dyn}}\)</span> is
comparable or less than the total simulation time will not have
phase-mixed debris and thus the escaped star particles will still reside
near the cluster.</p>

<h2 id="sec:Computer">The computer is a tool</h2>
<p>Not too long ago, I took a course where one of the professors made a
rather blunt observation: “You’re bad at math, <em>really bad at
math</em>." Surprisingly, this comment was not meant to be a targeted
insult to our self-esteem, as he included himself in this comment, but
rather a generational observation. He was comparing physicists born
before and after approximately 1980, drawing a distinction between those
who grew up with computers and those who did not. He went on to say,
“There’s just something different about those who couldn’t look
solutions up online and had no access to Wolfram Alpha; you can see it
in the way they carry themselves."</p>
<p>I’ve spent a lot of time reflecting on his words, and I’ve come to
see the truth in them. While I may sometimes romanticize the idea of
being so sharp that I could effortlessly use Bessel functions of the
first kind to solve partial differential equations right after
breakfast, I also appreciate the skill set we’ve gained in exchange:
<em>programming</em>. The computer has proven to be a remarkably
powerful tool, and it has fundamentally changed the way we approach
problem-solving.</p>
<p>When I embarked on this thesis, my primary tools were Python,
utilizing libraries like Numpy for data manipulation and Matplotlib for
plotting. However, as the scope of my work expanded to writing code for
numerical simulations, I found myself diving headfirst into the world of
Fortran. At the same time, this transition also involved mastering SSH
connections to remote machines, writing code with task parallelization,
submitting jobs to supercomputers, and efficiently managing a complex
code project using Git. Additionally, I had to navigate the challenges
of handling and processing hundreds of gigabytes of data.</p>
<p>At the outset of my thesis, a crucial question I pondered was
<em>how</em> to perform the orbital computations necessary for my
research. Initially, our published work in <span class="citation"
data-cites="2023A&amp;A...673A..44F">Ferrone et al. (2023)</span> relied
on a custom Fortran script that we had developed. However, as our
project evolved and our ambitions grew to include more complex physics,
we recognized the need for a substantial overhaul of the code. I was
well aware of the common programming pitfall of reinventing the wheel
when existing solutions are available. To explore alternative options, I
delved into the Python package known as <code>Galpy</code> <span
class="citation" data-cites="2015ApJS..216...29B">(Bovy 2015)</span>,
which offers a range of useful functions for computing orbits within a
Galactic context.</p>
<p>While <code>Galpy</code> had its merits, it lacked the flexibility
required for accommodating the time-varying potentials we needed in our
simulations. As a result, I embarked on a journey to develop my own
extensive code, tailored to the specific demands of my research.</p>
<p>While this code is not yet fully prepared for public release, it can
be accessed at <a href="https://gitlab.obspm.fr/sferrone/gc-tidal-loss"
class="uri">https://gitlab.obspm.fr/sferrone/gc-tidal-loss</a>. The code
is a hybrid of Python and Fortran. Fortran is utilized for orbital
computations, whereas Python is employed for data management and
analysis. The subsequent three sections provide detailed insights into
the code: integration units are explained in Section <a
href="#sec:integrationUnits" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:integrationUnits">3.1.1</a>, a concise code
walk-through is presented in Section <a
href="#sec:MinimumWorkingExample" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:MinimumWorkingExample">3.1.2</a>, and the handling
of uncertainties is discussed in Section <a href="#sec:uncertainties"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:uncertainties">3.1.3</a>.</p>
<h3 id="sec:integrationUnits">Integration units</h3>
<p>In astronomy, we employ a distinct set of units that defies the
conventions of the International System of Units (SI). This deviation is
warranted due to the vast cosmic distances, time scales spanning the age
of the universe, and the immense masses of celestial objects, rendering
the use of meters, seconds, and kilograms impractical and unintuitive.
Furthermore, from a computational perspective, it is advantageous to
work with unit values that are close to unity rather than dealing with
quantities that span several orders of magnitude, as this can help
reduce round-off errors.</p>
<p>In our astronomical system of units, we rely on three fundamental
dimensions: mass, time, and length. But in fact we will choose length,
<em>velocity</em>, and mass to be the fundamental units and let the
time, acceleration, and gravitational constant be derived: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    L &amp;= 1 \mathrm{kpc},&amp;
V&amp;=1\mathrm{km/s},&amp;M=1\mathrm{M}_{\odot}.
\end{aligned}\]</span> These choices offer several advantages. First,
the distance from the sun to the center of the galaxy is approximately 8
kiloparsecs (kpc), making the kiloparsec a natural unit for astronomical
distances. Line-of-sight velocities are typically measured in kilometers
per second (km/s), and the typical speed of stars in the galaxy is on
the order of 200 km/s. Using a solar mass as the unit for mass allows
for a quick estimate of the number of stars in a system. For instance,
galaxies have masses between <span
class="math inline">\(10^{10}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(10^{12}\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{M}{\odot}\)</span>, while globular
clusters have masses between <span class="math inline">\(10^{4}\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(10^{6}\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{M}{\odot}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this choice of units will naturally constrain the other
units in our system. When converting from SI units, the gravitational
constant becomes: <span class="math display">\[G = 4.3009 \times 10^{-6}
\left(\frac{\mathrm{km}}{\mathrm{s}}\right)^2 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}^{-1}
\mathrm{kpc}.\]</span> A great way to remember the new units of the
gravitational constant is to first recognize that gravitational
potential has units of velocity squared, and subsequently imagine the
the Keplerian potential: <span class="math inline">\(\Phi =
G\frac{M}{r}\)</span>. Thus, the gravitational constants requires
inverse mass and distance to result in velocity squared. Next, the unit
of time of time in our system becomes: <span class="math display">\[t =
\frac{l}{v} = 1  \frac{\mathrm{kpc}}{\mathrm{km}}\mathrm{s}.\]</span>
This unit may seem unconventional, but it has a numerical value of
approximately 0.98 billion years (Gyr), making the integration units
slightly smaller than a billion years. A useful mnemonic to remember
this unit derivation is that 1 kilometer per second (km/s) is roughly
equivalent to 1 kiloparsec per gigayear (kpc/Gyr). With this
understanding, we can quickly estimate the duration of a "galactic
year." Given that the Sun has a circular velocity of about 220 km/s at a
radial distance of approximately 8 kpc from the Galactic center, it
takes approximately 0.22 Gyr or 220 million years to complete one
orbit.</p>
<p>Regarding the unit of acceleration, we can derive it from the
relation <span class="math inline">\(g = -\nabla \Phi\)</span>, which
represents a change in velocity squared per unit length: <span
class="math inline">\(\left(\frac{\mathrm{km}}{\mathrm{s}}\right)^2
\mathrm{kpc}^{-1}\)</span>. When multiplied by a unit of time, we once
again obtain a unit of velocity. This definition aligns with the concept
of acceleration as the time derivative of velocity, where dividing the
unit of velocity by the unit of time yields units consistent with the
gradient of the potential.</p>
<h3 id="sec:MinimumWorkingExample">Minimum example</h3>
<p>Here, in order to explain the mechanics of the code I wrote for my
thesis, I provide a minimum example. Originally, I began writing a
minimum <em>working</em> example, however, it became to cluttered for a
small first year report. A minimum working example already exists can be
provided upon request.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="host-integration">Host integration</h4>
<p>Assuming that you are working in a Jupyter notebook and have already
imported the necessary modules and loaded the required data, the initial
step for using this numerical integrator is to provide the parameters
for the Galaxy:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" data-language="python"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>integrator.setstaticgalaxy(MWgravfield[<span class="dv">0</span>],MWgravfield[<span class="dv">1</span>])</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first argument, <code>MWgravfield[0]</code>, specifies the name
of the potential, which tells the code which subroutine to use.
Typically, “pouliasis2017pii" is used. The next argument,
<code>MWgravfield[1]</code>, is a Python list of floating-point numbers
representing the parameters of the various components of the potential.
These parameters include the masses and scale lengths. The order and
number of parameters must match the potential you’re using. For example,
“pouliasis2017pii" expects 11 parameters, including the gravitational
constant, four halo parameters, and three disc parameters for thin and
thick discs.</p>
<p>After specifying the potential, you need to provide the initial
positions and velocities of the particles you want to integrate. Each of
the arrays passed should have a length of <code>N</code>, where
<code>N</code> is the number of particles you intend to integrate:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" data-language="python"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>integrator.setinitialkinematics(</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>        GCcoord.x.value,GCcoord.y.value,GCcoord.z.value,</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>        GCcoord.v_x.value,GCcoord.v_y.value,GCcoord.v_z.value)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This code snippet provides the positions and kinematics of all
globular cluster coordinates. The <code>.value</code> is included at the
end of each variable because they are Astropy Quantities that include
both numbers and units. Using <code>.value</code> returns the
floating-point number without the unit. Passing an
<code>Astropy.Quantity</code> instance to the Fortran module would
result in an error. Finally, you can set the integration parameters of
the system:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3" data-language="python"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>integrator.setintegrationparameters(T.value,dt.value,NSTEP)  </span></code></pre></div>
<p>The previous steps can be understood as initialization. With all the
information in place, now the positions and the velocities can be
integrated:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4" data-language="python"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>xt,yt,zt,vxt,vyt,vzt<span class="op">=</span>integrator.leapfrogintime(</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>        integrator.ntimesteps,</span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>        integrator.nparticles)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Notice that the number of time steps and particles must be passed as
arguments to this subroutine. This may seem redundant since the number
of particles, <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, is known from the
<code>setinitialkinematics</code>, and the number of time steps was
established in the previous step. However, since the values are not
known at compilation time for the subroutine, they need to be passed at
runtime. The orbits of each globular cluster over the course of 1
billion years are shown in Fig. <a href="#fig:all-orbits"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:all-orbits">[fig:all-orbits]</a>.</p>
<p><img src="images/allorbits-example.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="images/example-integration.png" alt="image" /></p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="particle-integration">Particle
integration</h4>
<p>After the orbit of the host is obtained, a very similar procedure is
followed to create the streams. I.e. first the system must be
initialized and then the integration call is made. There are two main
differences. The first is that we must now generate the initial
positions of the star-particles within a globular cluster. I wrote a
code to create the initial conditions as discussed in section <a
href="#sec:DistributionFunctionSampling" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:DistributionFunctionSampling">2.1.2</a>.</p>
<pre><code>    xp,yp,zp,vxp,vyp,vzp=particleDistributions.isotropicplummer(
        G.value,mass.value,halfmassradius.value,NP) </code></pre>
<p>Now we shift these positions and velocities to about the globular
cluster of interest, which is identified with a
<code>GCindex</code>.</p>
<pre><code>    xi=xp+GCcoord.x.value[GCindex]
    yi=yp+GCcoord.y.value[GCindex]
    zi=zp+GCcoord.z.value[GCindex]
    vxi=vxp+GCcoord.v_x.value[GCindex]
    vyi=vyp+GCcoord.v_y.value[GCindex]
    vzi=vzp+GCcoord.v_z.value[GCindex]</code></pre>
<p>Now the initial positions and integration parameters are established,
just as before:</p>
<pre><code>    integrator.setstaticgalaxy(MWgravfield[0],MWgravfield[1])
    integrator.setintegrationparameters(T.value,dt.value,NSTEP)
    integrator.setinitialkinematics(xi,yi,zi,vxi,vyi,vzi)</code></pre>
<p>Here is the second main difference, which is that the positions and
velocities of the host must also be passed:</p>
<pre><code>    thost=np.linspace(0,T.value,NSTEP+1)
    integrator.inithostperturber(
        thost,
        xt[GCindex,0:NSTEP+1],
        yt[GCindex,0:NSTEP+1],
        zt[GCindex,0:NSTEP+1],
        vxt[GCindex,0:NSTEP+1],
        vyt[GCindex,0:NSTEP+1],
        vzt[GCindex,0:NSTEP+1],
        mass.value,
        characteristicradius.value)    </code></pre>
<p>During the computation, the Fortran module will evaluate the current
time of the system, determine the position of the host, and compute its
force on all of the particles specified in the initial conditions. You
might wonder why velocities are passed, given that the gravitational
force only requires the position. The reason is that during the
integration, we evaluate the energy of each particle relative to the
center of mass to determine whether the particle is bound or unbound.
Therefore, we must know the host’s velocity to calculate the kinetic
energy of each star particle. Finally, the integration of the particles
is executed using the following command:</p>
<pre><code>    integrator.leapfrogtofinalpositions()</code></pre>
<p>This subroutine integrates the positions of the particles to the end.
In this subroutine, we do not need to pass the number of steps nor the
number of particles since we are not saving the intermediate positions.
Therefore, we do not need to allocate arrays at run-time, unlike the
previous <code>leapfrogintime</code> subroutine. The output of this
example is shown in the right panels of Fig. <a href="#fig:all-orbits"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:all-orbits">[fig:all-orbits]</a>, where the orbit of
the globular cluster of interest, Palomar 5, is shown in blue. The
initial configuration of the Plummer system is depicted with the green
dots. Each particle is integrated for 1 Gyr, all the while experiencing
the gravitational forces from both the galaxy and the Plummer sphere
representing the host. This provides the output shown with the red
dots</p>
<h3 id="sec:uncertainties">Uncertainties</h3>
<p>There are different types of uncertainty affecting this project: (1)
observational uncertainties, (2) modelling uncertainty, and (3)
numerical uncertainty. I will briefly discuss each one here, although
the final draft of the thesis will include a much more rich
discussion.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="observational-uncertainty">Observational
uncertainty</h4>
<p>Regarding the observational uncertainty, most of the quantities
reported in <span class="citation"
data-cites="2021yCat..74781520B">Baumgardt and Hilker (2021)</span> are
accompanied with errors. We approximate the uncertainties as <span
class="math inline">\(1\sigma\)</span> Gaussian errors. The kinematic
properties of the clusters are reported in right ascension (RA),
declination (DEC), solar distance <span
class="math inline">\(R_{\mathrm{sun}}\)</span>, proper motions in RA
&amp; DEC, as well as line-of-sight velocities. Uncertainties are
included on all of the above save for RA and DEC, since their
uncertainties are negligible compared to the others. Additionally, the
uncertainties in the proper motions are correlated, which consider.
Regarding the internal dynamics, the dataset includes a rich set of
parameters such as velocity anisotropy, and core-density concentration.
We do not consider these values since we are using a simplified Plummer
sphere. The limitations due to these simplifications are discussed next.
From the database, we extract the half-mass radii of the clusters as
well as the mass–which contain uncertainties that we consider. In all,
for each globular cluster, we create 50 sets of initial conditions. One
set of initial conditions contains a realization of the kinematic
parameters and a distribution of 100,000 particles. Thus, the possible
the uncertainties in the position and kinematics drive the orbital
uncertainty while the mass of the cluster drives the uncertainty in the
internal dynamics. Examples of different orbits based on the sampling of
the initial conditions for pairs of phase space coordinates for three
globular clusters is presented in Fig. <a
href="#fig:orbit-uncertainties" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:orbit-uncertainties">[fig:orbit-uncertainties]</a>.</p>

<h4 class="unnumbered" id="modelling-uncertainties">Modelling
uncertainties</h4>
<p>All models are wrong. Therefore, as a numerical modeler, it’s
critical to ask questions such as, ‘How accurate is my model? What
specific inquiries can my model address? And conversely, what questions
is it incapable of answering?’ It’s imperative to recognize and
acknowledge the limitations of your model.</p>
<p>In this experiment, there are primarily two significant sources of
modeling uncertainties. The first pertains to how we represent the
gravitational field of the Milky Way, while the second concerns the
internal dynamics of the globular clusters.</p>
<p>Numerous gravitational models for the Milky Way exist. In our study,
we focused on three specific models. The first two models, as documented
in <span class="citation"
data-cites="2017A&amp;A...598A..66P">(Pouliasis, Di Matteo, and Haywood
2017)</span>, were considered, and we also explored a modified version
of a model therein, which incorporates a rotating stellar bar. It’s
worth noting that our research aims to explore additional models to
determine which ones yield stellar streams that best replicate
observations.</p>
<p>Another modeling decision we made concerns the duration for which we
integrated the orbits of the globular clusters, which we set at 5 Gyr.
This timespan is sufficiently long to induce a notable amount of tidal
loss from the globular clusters. Equally important, this period is a
safe choice, considering that the Milky Way can be assumed to be in
relatively stable equilibrium. To illustrate, the last significant
merger event that had a substantial impact on the Milky Way’s mass and
equilibrium, involving the disintegration of a satellite—likely
Sagittarius—occurred over 5 Gyr ago <span class="citation"
data-cites="2020MNRAS.498.2472K">(Kruijssen et al. 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the internal dynamics of the globular clusters play a
crucial role in determining both the rate and the specific stars that
are ejected over time. Globular clusters present a unique challenge due
to their two-body relaxation time comparable to the typical age of
globular clusters, approximately 10 Gyr. An intriguing phenomenon
resulting from the collisions between stars within globular clusters is
known as "mass segregation." This phenomenon leads to more massive stars
tending to migrate toward the cluster’s center, while less massive stars
are pushed toward the outskirts.</p>
<p>The study conducted by <span class="citation"
data-cites="2018MNRAS.474.2479B">Balbinot and Gieles (2018)</span>
underscored the importance of mass segregation in understanding stellar
streams and revealed some seemingly counterintuitive outcomes. For
instance, if the mass of a globular cluster increases, one might expect
its tidal tails to be brighter due to a higher number of potentially
escaped stars. However, mass segregation causes more low-mass stars to
escape, which are dimmer, resulting in difficult-to-observe tails.</p>
<p>Properly addressing the internal dynamics of globular clusters is
indeed a computationally expensive task. In our current treatment, we
adopt an <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}(n)\)</span> computation
time, focusing on integrating particles influenced by a gravitational
field only. A higher-order approach would involve considering N-body
interactions, which would have a computational complexity of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}(n^2)\)</span>. However, even this
doesn’t constitute the most accurate description of the dynamics. To
achieve a more precise representation, one would need to account for the
mass distribution of stars within the cluster and establish an initial
configuration, potentially following a distribution like the Kroupa mass
function <span class="citation" data-cites="2001MNRAS.322..231K">(Kroupa
2001)</span>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the presence of binary star systems poses a challenge.
Accounting for binary stars would significantly reduce the code’s
computational speed because the dynamical timescale for binary star
systems is on the order of a few years. This reduction in integration
time-step could exceed four orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>Additionally, the issue of stellar remnants and black holes within
the centers of globular clusters is worth considering. We’re not
suggesting that Newtonian mechanics must be abandoned in favor of
general relativity due to black holes in the cluster. However, it’s
important to acknowledge that the presence of a very massive object at
the system’s center can significantly impact the dynamics, as has been
observed <span class="citation" data-cites="2023MNRAS.522.5740V">(Vitral
et al. 2023)</span>.</p>
<p>The primary objective of this thesis is to gain insights into the
distribution of tidal debris emanating from the entire globular cluster
system. As a result, we must make certain simplifications that enable us
to make predictions for all approximately 150 globular clusters. This
involves Monte Carlo sampling of orbital uncertainties and exploring
various galactic potential models. Given the scope of our work, a
comprehensive exploration of the internal dynamics to a high degree of
precision is currently unfeasible for the entire system. Nevertheless,
we may delve into this aspect on a per-cluster basis in the future if
higher resolution is deemed necessary.</p>
<p>We find our approach acceptable for several reasons. First, once
particles escape from the globular cluster, their motion is largely
governed by the Milky Way’s gravitational field. Our primary concern is
ensuring the rate at which particles escape from the clusters in our
models aligns with reality. Since the primary drivers of mass loss are
tidal forces and the three-body problem, we are confident in the results
our models yield. Furthermore, <span class="citation"
data-cites="2012A&amp;A...546L...7M">Mastrobuono-Battisti et al.
(2012)</span> has demonstrated that there is hardly a difference in the
morphology of tidal tails when comparing N-body simulations to
test-particle simulations.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="numerical-uncertainty">Numerical
uncertainty</h4>
<p>The numerical accuracy of the orbital solutions is a crucial
consideration, as numerical errors can introduce artificial acceleration
to particles, potentially leading to an inflated mass loss rate.
Numerical uncertainties are primarily influenced by the size of the
integration time-step and the chosen numerical method. In our approach,
we utilize a leap-frog integration scheme.</p>
<p>To determine an appropriate time-step for each system, we first
integrated the star-particles within each globular clusters in isolation
for 1 Gyr, employing an initial time-step of <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta t = 10^5~\mathrm{yr}\)</span>. During this
integration, we calculated the mean energy conservation relative to the
initial energy of the system, denoted as <span
class="math inline">\(\langle\delta E\rangle/E_0\)</span>. For
approximately two-thirds of the clusters, a typical energy drift smaller
than <span class="math inline">\(10^{-10}\)</span> was observed.
However, the remaining clusters required higher resolution.
Consequently, we reduced the time-step to <span
class="math inline">\(10^4~\mathrm{yr},\)</span> ensuring that the
energy drift rate remained below <span
class="math inline">\(10^{-10}\)</span> for all clusters.</p>
<p>In the current version of the code, we have refined the method for
evaluating numerical uncertainties. A detailed analysis of this process
will be presented in the accompanying published article on our methods.
In summary, we expanded our investigation to assess the effects of
temporal resolution on the orbits of globular clusters. Given that the
dynamical time of a globular cluster within the Galaxy is significantly
shorter than the dynamical time of a particle within the cluster,
there’s no need for an ultra-short time-step to ensure energy
conservation. However, we adjusted the time-step to guarantee that the
drift in the final positions of the globular clusters after 5 Gyr is
significantly smaller than their characteristic sizes.</p>

individual clusters. From Fig. <a href="#fig:LB_count_density"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:LB_count_density">4.1</a>,
we see that a rich varieities of morhologies are present and not only
the thin stellar streams which are commonly championed in the
literature. It is instructive to look at the tidal debris resultant from
one globular cluster at a time, to get an intuition for the different
morphologies that are available.</p>
<p>In Fig. <a href="#fig:NGC5986" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:NGC5986">4.4</a>, we show case the orbit and tidal
debris of NGC 5986. This is a very instructive example. For instance,
recalling the discussion on phase-mixing, we note that this cluster has
complete many orbits. As a result, the tidal debris completely occupies
all possible states that are accessible to the initial conditions. Note
that, in the middle panel, I have colored the recently escaped particles
in pink. When truncating to the these particles, we do see that they
trace the recent past of the cluster as well as the future leg of the
orbit. Thus, even when the tidal debris has been phase-mixed, we can
still observe a coherrent stream near a cluster.</p>
<p>Next, the cluster’s tidal debris does not cover the entire sky. This
is because the apo-center of the orbit is still within the solar
circle.</p>

<p>A final interesting note that I wish to discuss in this report, as
any good numerical modeler should do, is compare our results to the
observations. Fig. <a href="#fig:NGC4590" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:NGC4590">[fig:NGC4590]</a> shows tracks of the same
stellar stream compiled from three different studies within <span
class="citation" data-cites="2023MNRAS.520.5225M">Mateu (2023)</span>.
We have remarkable agreement for much of the length of the stream.
Notice that our stream goes beyond the observations. This is because the
observations are limited. Stellar crowding and extinction in the
galactic-mid plane render observations difficult in this region.</p>
<p>Additionally, notice that the model prediction of the stream of the
right panel of Fig. <a href="#fig:NGC4590" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:NGC4590">[fig:NGC4590]</a>. This galactic model
included a bar. An intriguing result is that this demonstrates that the
stellar streams can be used a diagnostic tools on the bar. However, a
precise explanation as to why the bar reduces the length of the stream
instead of, say, cutting the stream, still eludes me.</p>

<h2 id="future-work">Future work</h2>
<p>We want to include more realistic and complex phenomena within the
Galactic field to study how this would impact the tidal debris
originating from globular clusters. Several paths of investigation are
available to us: the stellar bar, the effects of the Magellanic clouds,
the in-fall of Sagittarius, giant molecular clouds, dark matter halos,
etc. As a first step, we modified the code to allow for the globular
clusters to interact with one another. This experiment is nearly
finished and ready for a publication. To summarize here, in step 1 of
our methods as described in section <a href="#sec:MinimumWorkingExample"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:MinimumWorkingExample">3.1.2</a>, we integrate the
globular clusters with N-Body interactions. Then, in step 2, we allows
the star-particles of a given globular cluster feel the gravitational
force of all the globular clusters in the galaxy as well as its host and
the galaxy. The results are promising, we have assembled a near complete
first draft of a letter focusing on a specific analysis of Palomar 5.
Then, we wish to expand the work to all globular clusters in the
publication of a full article.</p>
<p>After which, there are three paths that I wish to continue pursuing.
(1) including more physics in the simulations. (2) searching for more
stellar streams in the real data using the simulation results as a
prior. (3) implementing stellar evolution and internal dynamics in the
code so that we can create mock-observations.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this report. I look forward to
returning to you with more results.</p>
