\section{Velocity distribution within the stream}

    \subsection{Self-Segregation and Stream Chilling}

    The classic collisionless boltzmann equation:
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{df}{dt} = 0 = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial v} \frac{dv}{dt}+ \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} 
    \end{equation}

    we are saying that the pusles drift with the same velocities thus $\frac{dv}{dt}=0$. I impart more assumptions, namely that: $\rho(x,t=0)=\delta(x)$ and that velocity is defined as a normal distribution that does not change over time. This means that I can write the initial distribution function as:
    
    \begin{equation}
        f(x,v,t=0) = \delta(x)\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\textrm{exp}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{v-\langle v \rangle}{\sigma}\right)^2\right)
    \end{equation}    

    the solution to the evolution of the density is $\rho = \int f dv$, and you also need to perform this variable substitution $f(x,v,t) = f(x-vt,v,0)$

    \begin{equation}
        \rho(x,t) = \frac{1}{\sigma_v t \sqrt{2\pi} }\textrm{exp}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\langle v \rangle t}{\sigma_v t}\right)^2\right)
    \end{equation}
