\section{Elliptical coordinates}
    \textbf{these are results of an unfinished attempt to understand the effect of the bar from a more theoretical point of view}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Explain the elliptical coordinates 
        \item show the solutions that worked
        \item show the solutions that blew up 
        \item using eigenvalues of the jacobian for studying numerical stability 
        \item "They are a useless complication"
        \item Spherical harmonics 
    \end{itemize}
